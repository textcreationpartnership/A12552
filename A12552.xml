            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It may be thought moſt ſtraung, that a man should oft tymes chandg his Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; it cannot be accounted a commendable quality in any man to make many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; chandges in ſuch weighty matters, as are the caſes of conſcience: but if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy be comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable in any thing, it is moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in the beſt things which is Religion: &amp; it inconſtancy be worthy reproof in matters of inferior eſtimation, it is much more blameable in matters of Salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: In reſpect wherof the wiſeſt &amp; moſt Religions men have been alwayes moſt conſtant in ther profeſſion &amp; faith: &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant perſons cannot eſcape the deſerved imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of folly or weaknes of judgment therein.</p>
            <p>This muſt needs be true, (&amp; we confeſſe it) if one condition be admitted, that the Religon which a man chandgeth be the truth: For otherwiſe to chandge a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is commendable, &amp; to retaine a falſe Religion is damnable. For a man of a Turk to become a Iew, of a Iew to become a Papiſt, of a Papiſt to become a Proteſtant are al commendable chandges though they al of them befal one &amp; the ſame perſon in one yeere, nay, if it were in one month: So that not to chandg Religion is evil ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: &amp; therfor that we should fal from the profeſſion of Puritaniſme to Browniſme, &amp; from Browniſme to true Chriſtian baptiſme, is not ſimply evil or reprovable in it ſelf, except it be proved that we have fallen from true Religion: If wee therfor being formerly deceaved in the way of Pedobaptiſtry, now doe embrace the truth in the true Chriſtian Apoſtolique baptiſme: Then let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impute this as a fault vnto vs: This therfor is the queſtion: whither the baptiſme of infants be lawful, yea or nay: &amp; whither perſons baptized being infants muſt not renounce that falſe baptiſme, &amp; aſſume the true baptiſme of Chr: which is to be adminiſtred vppon perſons confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their faith &amp; their ſinnes: This being the controverſy now betwixt vs, &amp; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration commonly called Browniſts: For the glory of God, the manifeſting of the truth to our own nation, &amp; the deſtruction of the man of ſinne, wee have thought good to publish this preſent treatiſe, wherin the whole cauſe is handled: Let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing their faith &amp; their ſinnes, are of one true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: &amp; therfor the Chu. of the Seperation being of the ſame conſtitution with England &amp; Rome, is a moſt vnnatural daughter to her mother England, &amp; her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother Rome, who being of the ſelf fame genealogie &amp; generation, (that of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet being true of her, as is the Mother ſo is the daughter) she dare notwithſtanding moſt impudently wipe her own mouth, &amp; cal her mother &amp; grandmother adultereſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes. Hee in therfor we do acknowledg our error, that we retayning the baptiſme of England which gave vs our conſtitution, did cal our mother England an harlot, &amp; vppon a falſe ground made our Seperation from her: For although it be neceſſary that we Seperate from England, yet no man can Seperate from England as from a falſe Chu. except he alſo do Seperate from the baptiſme of England, which giveth England her conſtitution: &amp; whoſoever doth retaine the baptiſme of England doth with al retaine the conſtitution of England, &amp; cannot without ſinne cal England an harlot as we have done: &amp; this we deſire may be wel minded of al that Seperate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> England: For if they retaine the baptiſme of England, viz the baptiſme of infants as true baptiſme, they cannot Seperate from England as from a falſe Chu. though they may Seperate for corruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; whoſoever doth Seperate from England as from a falſe Church, muſt needs Seperate from the baptiſme of England, as from falſe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: For the baptiſme of England cannot be true &amp; to be retayned, &amp; the Chu. of England falſe &amp; to de rejected: neither can the Chu. of England poſſibly be falſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the baptiſme be falſe, vnleſſe a true conſtitution could be in a falſe Chu. which is as impoſſible as for light to have felowship with darknes: It is impoſſible that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traryes or contradictions should be both true: &amp; ſo it is impoſſible that a falſe Chur. should have a true conſtitution or a true baptiſme: To ſay thus:
<list>
                  <item>England hath a falſe conſtitution.</item>
                  <item>England hath a true baptiſme, is as much as to ſay thus.</item>
                  <item>England hath a true conſtitution.</item>
                  <item>England hath a true conſtitution, which is to contradict:</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But the Seperation they ſay England hath a falſe conſtitution, &amp; is a falſe Chu. &amp; to be Seperated from: &amp; yet they ſay alſo: England hath a true baptiſme (that is a true conſtitution) which is not to be Seperated from: For a true conſtitution &amp; true baptiſme are one &amp; the ſame: So is a falſe conſtitution &amp; a falſe baptiſme: So that the ſpeeches &amp; actions of the Seperation are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictory in this particular. Finaly, they that defend the baptiſme of infants cannot with any truth or good conſcience Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from England as from a falſe Chu. though they may ſeperate for coruptions: &amp; they that do Seperate from England as from a falſe Chu. muſt of ſneceſſity Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the baptiſme of England, &amp; account the baptiſme of England falſe, &amp; ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the baptiſme of infants falſe baptiſme: Therfor the Seperation muſt either goe
<pb facs="tcp:26301:3"/> back to England, or go forward to true baptiſme: &amp; al that shal in tyme to come Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from England muſt Seperate from the baptiſme of England, &amp; if they wil not Seperate from the baptiſme of England their is no reaſon why they should ſeperate from England as from a falſe Church: &amp; this is more at large proved in the ſecond queſtion of this diſcourſe, whither the Reader is to be referred. Now concerning this point of baptiſing infants we do profeſſe before the L. &amp; before al men in ſincerity &amp; truth that it ſemeth vnto vs the moſt vnreaſonable hereſy of al Antichriſtianiſme: for conſidering what baptiſme is, an infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is no more capable of baptiſme then is any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable or inſenſible creature: For baptiſme is not washing with water: but it is the baptiſme of the Spirit, the confeſſion of the mouth, &amp; the washing with water: how then can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without great folly wash with water which is the leaſt &amp; laſt of baptiſme, one that is not baptized with the Spirit, &amp; cannot confeſſe with the mouth: or how is it baptiſme if one be ſo washed: Now that an infant cannot be bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized with the Spirit is plaine, 1. Pet. 3:21. wher the Apoſtle ſaith that the baptiſme of the Spirit is the queſtion of a good conſcience into God, &amp; Heb. 10.22. wher the baptiſme which is inward is caled the ſprinkling of the hart from an evil conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: ſeing therfor infants neither have an evil conſcience, nor the queſtion of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor the purging of the hart, for al theſe are proper to actual ſinners: hence it followeth that infants baptiſme is folly &amp; nothing. Againe: Iohns baptiſme was the baptiſme of repentance: infants have not repentance: &amp; therfor cannot have the bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme of repentance. That infants cannot have repentance is evident, ſeing repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is knowledg of ſinne by the Law, ſorrow for ſinne by the goſpel, mortification of ſin &amp; new obedience, al which are as much in the baſen of water, as in the infant bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Now I confeſſe the Pedobaptiſts have many showes of reaſon for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their hereſy, &amp; one man shapeth them into one forme, another man into an other, as every mans wit &amp; learning teacheth him, but indeed they are al built vpon the ſelf ſame ſandy fondacions, the wreſting of ſome places of Scripture: al which (in a manner) are diſcovered in ſome meaſure in this treatiſe: whereby the reader may perceave the manifeſt perventing of the ſcriptures from their true ſenſe: Now bicauſe men cal for antiquity, &amp; except they ſee antiquity they wil not beleve, though the Scriptures be the moſt auncient, I have thought good therefore to propound two pregnant teſtimonyes of Antiquity (beſides that which is alledged in the pag. 30. &amp; 31. of this treatiſe) againſt baptiſme of infants: that men may know that this truth al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo hath her footſteps among the Fathers.</p>

Let them by baptiſme be made Chriſtians when they can know Chr. by inſtruction: why doth the innocent age haſten to the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes: we deale more ſafely in worldly matters: Shal we commit heavenly things to yong children vnto whome we dare not commit our earthly ſubſtance? let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt know how to ask ſalvation that ſo we may ſeem to give to him that asketh.</q>

               <p>Againe, whereas you affirme that by the broaching of theſe opinions &amp; ſome for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer erroneous &amp; offenſive, the truth is like more to be blaſphemed, &amp; therfore you could wish that wee your comtrymen &amp; frends had never fallen into them: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that although I shal not rejoyce that any truth be evil ſpoken of, yet if it shall fal out by occaſion of publishing the truth that wicked men blaſpheme, let them know that Chriſt is a rock of offence, &amp; a ſtone to ſtumble at: &amp; if any be hindered from the truth by publishing the truth, it wilbe their corruption &amp; ſin, &amp; the truth or the publishing of the truth is not in fault: but if you feare hereby that your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Church wil fal to the ground, I ſay, it is that which is appointed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, &amp; to perdition let it goe: I wil never vſe meanes to ſupport it.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26301:7"/> baptiſing infants, which firſt I will vndertake, &amp; then anſwere the reaſons to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>Gen. 17.20.</bibl> God made his covenant to Abraham &amp; to his ſeed: from whence I reaſon thus.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That covenant which God made with Abraham he commaunded to bee ſealed to him &amp; to al his ſeede, yea even to infants.</p>
               <p>But the covenant that we vnder the goſpel doe receive is the very ſame that was made to Abraham, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefor that is commaunded to be fealed to vs &amp;c to our ſeede, yea even to our infants, for ſo was that to Abrahams.</p>
               <p>The Major can not be denyed, ſee Gen. 17.10.11.12.</p>
               <p>The Minor is likewiſe as true, for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this covenant, Act. 2.39 ſayth, the promiſe is made to you &amp; to your children, &amp; to al that are a farre of, as many as the Lord our God shal cal. In which words it plainly appeareth that this is the very ſame covenant &amp; promiſſe that was made to Abraham, which they that were a far of, that is the Gentiles beleeving, doe receive &amp; were baptiſed into. And therefor is Abraham called the Father of many nations, Gen. 17.4. alſo Gal. 3.13.4. Chriſt is ſaid to redemne vs from the curſe of the Law, that the bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham might come on the Gentiles through Ieſ. Chr. that wee might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit, ſee verſ. 8.9. Now then if wee bee partakers of the ſame covenant (for otherwiſe Abrahams covenant should not be an everlaſting covenant, Gen. 17.7. ſeing his poſterity after the flesh is cut of for a tyme, Rom. 11, 15.17.20.) it muſt follow that the ſame muſt be ſealed to vs, &amp; to our infants, (els is it not the ſame) &amp; that by the commaundement of God. For the abolishing of circumciſion, &amp; the bringing in of baptiſme vnder the goſpel, doth not abrogate or diſanulle the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of ſealing the covenant to the beleeving parents with their infants, which was once commaunded to Abraham, but onely sheweth a changing of the outward ſigne. And therefore as the covenant belongs to the Gentiles beleeving ſo doth the ſeal thereof to them &amp; to their ſeede, as that did to Abraham &amp; to his ſeede: The outward ceremonie onely changed.</p>

               <p>Now in the next place you make a ſpecial preface to the firſt point, affirming that baptiſme of infants was denyed by Auxentius the Arrian, &amp; by Pelagius whom Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine &amp; others refuted &amp; condemned for hereſy, &amp; that by Scripture: I ſay that one heretique condemned another contrary to the Scriptures for the truths ſake &amp; whereas you bring in the Fathers in this particular point in your 6. pag. I anſwere I can prove that Auguſtine, Cyrill, Ciprian, Origen, Nazianzen, Ambroſe, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were almoſt as groſſe heretiques (if he be an heretique that holdeth an hereſy) as Auxentius &amp; Pelagius, &amp; you your ſelves account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all Antichriſtians: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the auncient practiſe of pedobaptiſtry in auncient antichriſtian Churches is no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26301:7"/> more to be reſpected then the auncient practiſe of the Prelacy &amp; read prayer in the fame: but theſe are but Florishes: let vs heare your arguments from the Scripture proving.<q> 1. That infants are to be baptiſed,</q>
               </p>
               <p>Your firſt argument is taken from Gen. 17.10. &amp; is framed thus:</p>
               <p>That covenant which God made with Abraham, he commaunded to be ſealed to him, &amp; to al his ſeed, yea even to infants.</p>
               <p>But the covenant that we vnder the goſpel do receave is the very ſame that was made to Abraham, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therfor it is commaunded to be ſealed to vs, &amp; to our ſeed, yea eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for ſo was it to Abrahams.</p>
               <p>To this argument I make answer thus: firſt diſtinguishing the two covenants or teſtaments (for a covenant &amp; teſtament is al one in the originals though the English words are two): one covenant was made with Abraham &amp; his carnal ſeed &amp; of that covenant was circumciſion a ſeale: another covenant made with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed, &amp; of that covenant the holy Spirit of promiſe is the ſeale: for the carnall covenant had a carnal ſeale vppon the carnal ſeed: the Spiritual covenant had a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſeale vppon the Spiritual ſeed: For things muſt be made proportionable, &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which was a carnal ſeale, could not ſeale vp the Spiritual covenant to the Spiritual ſeed, for to ſay ſo, is to leap over the hedg &amp; to make a disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the type &amp; the truth.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus diſtinguished let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee remembred &amp; applyed orderly &amp; the argument wil appeare of no value: for the major is thus to be vnderſtood if it be true that the carnal covenant which God made with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his carnal ſeed, was to be ſealed vp to his infants with a carnal ſeale, viz: circumciſion: if it be not ſo vnderſtood it is falſe: Now the minor, if it be aſſumed out of the major, (as it muſt be, els it is a Sophiſme) is very falſe &amp; flatly contradictory to the Scripture: for we vnder the goſpel do not receave that carnal covenant which was made to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham &amp; his carnal ſeed, whereof circumciſion was the carnal ſeale: but that carnal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant &amp; ſeale together with the ſubject of that ſeale, viz: a male of 8. dayes old is taken away by Chriſts croſſe: &amp; in the rome thereof we have the Spiritual covenant typed by that carnal covenant, &amp; the Spiritual ſeale viz: the holy Spirit of promiſe ſignified by that carnal ſeale, &amp; the Spiritual infant, viz: a new borne babe in Chriſt, in whom Chriſt typed by the male is newly formed, ſignified by that carnal infant.</p>
               <p>That al theſe particulars are ſo: I prove vnto you plainly by theſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are two Teſtaments made with Abraham, Gal. 4.24. For Agar that is the old Teſtament, &amp; Sara that is the new Teſtament, were both maryed to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Abraham had them both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are two ſeedes: Iſmaell (of Abraham &amp; Hagar) who typed the carnall ſeed borne after the Flesh: &amp; Iſaac (of Abraham &amp; Sara) who typed the Spiritual ſeed borne by promiſe vers. 23.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:26301:8"/>
               <p>There are two ſeales: Circumciſion a ſeale of the carnal covenant vppon the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal children: Gen. 17.11. &amp; the Holy Spirit of promiſe a ſeale of the Spirituall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vppon the Spiritual ſeed, 2. Cor. 1.22. Eph. 1.13. &amp; as circumciſion was a ſeale from God to the carnal ſeed of the promiſe &amp; from the carnall ſeed to God in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: So the Spirit of promiſe is a ſeale from God to the Spiritual ſeed of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, &amp; from the Spiritual ſeed to the Lord in obedience, Eph. 1.13. Ioh. 3.33. theſe things are evident: but now you, I am perſwaded of mere ignorance, miſtaking the covenant, doe make circumciſion a ſeale of the everlaſting Spiritual covenant, which is an error, &amp; therevppon you build all your falſe building of pedobaptiſtry which is as a howſe built vppon the ſand by the foolish builders.</p>
               <p>Now for your places of Scripture I expound them in order.</p>
               <p>Gen. 17.10.11.12. this place proveth that circumciſion was a ſeale of the carnall covenant made with the carnall ſeed, &amp; not a ſeale of the Spirituall covenant made with the Faithful: For the Spirit is the ſeale thereof, who is therfor called the Spirit of promiſe, &amp; the ſeale. Eph. 1.13. &amp; if the place of the Rom. 4.11. be objected to prove that circumciſion ſealed the righteouſnes of Faith to Abraham: I anſwer, that is not the ſcope of the place: but this: viz: that circumciſion had one ſpecialty in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham differing from al other, that by circumciſion he was ſealed vp to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of al the Faithful as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the matter of their juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely, that as he was juſtifyed by his actual Faith ſo should all the beleevers bee juſtifyed by their actuall Fayth whither they beleeved in their vncircumciſion or in their circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Act. 2.39. the promiſe is offered to the impenitent Iewes, &amp; to their poſterity, &amp; to the Gentils a far of: &amp; it was exhibited only to ſo many as yeelded obedience to the Fayth: &amp; whereas in rehearſing the Apoſtles ſpeech, you ſay, the promiſe is made I ſay, therein you ad to the text. For if you intend that the promiſe of the Spirit was exhibited to al the Iewes &amp; their infants, &amp; to the Gentils beleeving &amp; their infants &amp; that this place afordeth it, I ſay the place doth not intend any ſuch thing but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an offer of the Spiritual covenant, to the carnal Iewes &amp; their children, according to the Flesh, &amp; alſo the Gentils: but a true conferring or exhibiting of it to ſo many as should be effectually called by the offer of it in the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Further whereas you ſeem to aſſume that ſeing the covenant was made to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham &amp; his infants, it is therfor made to vs &amp; our infants. I deny that ever the cove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant Spiritual was made that is conferred to al Abrahams infants according to the Flesh: neyther therfor is it made that is conferred to al our infants: this you should prove, but it is vndone: I confeſſe the promiſe was offered to all Abrahams carnall ſeed vnder that carnal covenant of the Old Teſtament, &amp; ſo it is offered now to all our carnal children by the preaching of the goſpel in the new Teſtament: but as the Spiritual covenant was only exhibited to the Faithful, the true ſeed of Abraham, ſo is it now only exhibited to the Faithful which are the only true ſeed of Abraham, who is the Father of vs al, &amp; wee al his children, &amp; juſtified by actual Faith as he was: in reſpect whereof infants wanting actual Fayth cannot bee truely ſaid the Children of Abraham but are that they are in ſecreat to the Lord whatſoever they are.</p>

               <p>Your ſecond argument followeth: from Coll. 2.11.12. which is framed thus.</p>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>If circumciſion belonged to Faythful Abraham &amp; his ſeed, yea to ſuch as were but infants: then doth baptiſme alſo aperteyne to all beleevers &amp; to their ſeed being infants.</item>
                  <item>But the firſt is true, Gen. 17.10. </item>
                  <item>Ergo the ſecond.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The reaſon of the conſequent is double: 1. for that baptiſme cometh in place of circumciſion as a ſeale of the ſame promiſes to vs &amp; our ſeed: Col. 2.11.12. 2. For that the covenant muſt be as largely ſealed vp to vs as to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therfor to our females as wel as males, &amp; infants as wel as perſons of yeeres: For the covenant in Chriſt is not leſſened but of as larg extent now as then: 2. Cor. 1.20. Seing in Chriſt all the promiſes of God are yea &amp; amen.</p>
               <p>I answer that this argument is built vppon the ſame falſe ground with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer a meer miſtaking of the covenant, &amp; ſeale, &amp; ſeed: &amp; their is manifeſt violence committed vppon the Scripture by perverting &amp; wreſting it to falſe conſequents: firſt therfor I deny the conſequence &amp; I give reaſons of my deniall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Bicauſe circumciſion did not aperteyne to Abraham &amp; his infants as a ſeale of the everlaſting covenant of life &amp; Salvation, but of the external temporary covenant of the land of Canaan, &amp; of obedience to the Law of Moſes: &amp; therfor though cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion aperteyned to Abraham &amp; his carnal infants as a ſeale of the external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant yet it doth not follow that baptiſme belongs to the Faythful &amp; their carnal infants as a ſeale of the Spiritual covenant of the New Teſtament made in reſpect of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly bicauſe the beleevers do not occupy Abrahams place in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the New Teſtament, bicauſe Abraham is the Father of all the Faythfull, but no man though never ſo Holy hath that perrogative to bee the Father of the Faythfull: Therefore Abraham receaveth the Faythfull into his boſome. Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, bicauſe the infants of the faithful do not poſſeſſe the place of the true children of Abraham the Father of the Faithful: but poſſeſſe the place of the typical
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26301:9"/> children of Abraham according to the Fleshe, &amp; therfor the diſproportion being in al theſe particulars the conſequence of the argument is weake &amp; inſufficient,</p>
               <p>But if you wil make true conſequents you muſt reaſon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the type to the truth proportionably, &amp; not from the type to the type as this argument importeth: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt you confound the covenants &amp; ſeales as you do: but muſt make al things diſtinct &amp; proportionable the one to the other as thus.</p>
               <p>Abraham the Father of the carnal infants: Abraham the Father of the Faithful: Carnal Abraham &amp; his carnal ſeed, carnally circumciſed: So Faithful Abraham &amp; his Faithful Children, Spiritually circumciſed. The carnal infants of the old Teſtament carnally circumciſed: The Spiritual infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the new Teſtament, that is, men regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate baptized.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſe the diſproportion of your argument, &amp; the true proportion that you ought to have made if your argument had been good.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſee the reaſons of your conſequence, &amp; the Scriptures you do produce for the confirmation of them: you ſay that baptiſme cometh in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ome of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as a ſeale of the ſame promiſes to vs &amp; our ſeed: I vtterly deny it: &amp; I prove the contrary vnto you: Seing that the circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the hart ſucceedeth in the place of circumciſing the flesh: Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2.29. &amp; circumciſion made without hands cometh in the place of circumciſion made with hands, Col. 2.11. compared with Eph. 2.11. &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion the ſeale of the flesh, hath the H. Spirit of promiſe which is the Spirituall ſeale to ſucceed in place therof, Eph. 1.13.14. which ſeale of the Spirit is the earneſt of our inheritance, as circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion of the flesh was an earneſt of the inheritance of the land of Canaan to the carnal Iſraelites: &amp; I deſire to be enformed in al the Scriptures where baptiſme is called a ſeale, for I deny that the baptiſme of water is the ſeale of the new Teſtament, though I cannot deny that the baptiſme of the holy ghoſt is the ſeale.</p>
               <p>I ſay therfor that the ſeale of the Spirit muſt go befor the baptiſme of water: &amp; as al the ordinances of the new Teſtament are Spiritual, &amp; yet viſible, ſo is the ſeale of the new Teſtament Spiritual, &amp; yet viſible: &amp; thervppon men being viſibly ſealed with the Spirit as Cornelius company was. Act. 10.47. may challendg the baptiſme with water, as Peter there teacheth: this viſible ſeale of the new Teſtament is confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as in the old Teſtament circumciſion was their confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; baptiſme is not a ſeale but a manifeſtation of the ſeale. You ſee therfor that baptiſme is not the ſeale of the new Teſtament, &amp; that circumciſion did not ſeale vp the everlaſting covenant to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, &amp; al his carnal ſeed: now the place of Col. 2.11.12. which you produce to prove that baptiſme cometh in the rome of circumciſion, is not ſo to be conſtrued, but the Apoſtle teacheth the vertue of Chr. circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; baptiſme, which is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying &amp; burying of ſinne &amp; reſurection from ſinne: &amp; the Apoſt. doth not intend to teach that in the new Teſtament baptiſme ſucceedeth for circumciſion: but hee teacheth the vertue of Ch. circumciſion &amp; baptiſme in the Faithful: ſo that ſeing cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumciſion was a ſeale of the promiſes of the old Teſtament to the carnal ſeed, &amp; that the Spirit is the ſeale of the promiſes of the new Teſtament to the faithful ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therfor neither doth baptiſme of water ſucceed circumciſion, neither doth baptiſme with water ſeale vp any promiſes to the Faithfull, but onely doth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26301:10"/> viſibly declare what promiſes they already are partakers of, viz: of the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>Againe: in your ſecond reaſon you would infinuate a reſtraynt in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1. baptiſme be not due to infants ſeing circumciſion was due to infants in the Old Teſtament: I answer many wayes: 1. Seing that baptisme doth not ſucceede cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, this alegation is nothing to the purpoſe: 2. Seing baptisme is both to male &amp; female it is larger then circumciſion which was only vppon the male: 3. ſeing that baptisme is both to Iew &amp; Gentil, therfor more larg then circumciſion: but theſe things are almoſt nothing to the purpoſe: Therfor I ſay more pertinently, That the covenant made with Abraham in reſpect of Chriſt is now as larg as ever it was. For that was never made with Abraham &amp; al his carnal children, but only with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham &amp; the Faythful, &amp; ſo it continueth in the ſame tenor ſtil: &amp; it is enlarged now ſince Chriſts comming only in reſpect of the cleerer, &amp; more vniverſal publication o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it: for then the covenant made with Abraham in reſpect of Chriſt was shadowed out darkly in types, now ſince Chriſt it is preached plainly: then it was only to the Iewes, now to al nations, Mat. 28.19. beſides I affirme that circumciſion was never a ſeale of that covenant that God made with Abraham in reſpect of Chriſt, for the Holy Spirit of promiſe is the ſeale of it: but circumciſion only was a ſeale of the exter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal covenant: &amp; the ſeale of the Spirit is as large as the ſeale of the Flesh For all the carnal Iſraelites were carnally ſealed, al the true beleevers are ſealed by the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>al the males were carnally ſealed, al that have the male Chriſt formed in them (whither men or weomen) are ſealed by the Spirit: For in Chriſt ther is neyther male nor female Gal. 3.28. al the carnal ſeed were carnally ſealed whither yong or old, ſo all the Spiritual ſeed are Spiritually ſealed whither new borne babes in Chriſt, or perfect men that are come to the meaſure of the age of the fulnes of Chriſt: &amp; ſo the covenant is not leſſened, taking things in their due proportion, &amp; not perverting them. &amp; whereas you ſay in Chriſt all the promiſes of God are yea &amp; amen, 2. Cor. 1.20. therby inſinuating that in the new Teſtament the covenant muſt be as large as in the old, I confeſſe it to be as larg, but this place is ſtrayned to the proving thereof: For the meaning of it is that vnto the Faythful all the Lords promiſes are verefied, but his promiſe was never that al their carnal ſeed should have baptisme as a ſeale of life &amp; ſalvation, but that al the beleevers should have the Spirit of promiſe which is the new Teſtaments ſeale.</p>

               <p>The aſſumption is proved Mat. 19.13.14,</p>
               <p>To this argument of yours I make answer diverſly: firſt you have not proved that the viſible Chur. &amp; al the ordinances therof perteyne to infants of the faithful: For the infants of the Iewes that were preſented to Chr. were not infants of belevers for ought that I ſee: neither can it be proved that they were infants of the Iewes, but their is ſome likelyhood to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: ſeing the diſciples repelled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: it may be they were the children of ſome of the Romane ſoldiers, or ſome Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitish perſons: but ſuppoſe they were children of the Iewes, how is it proved that their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were belevers? ſeing that the people of the Iewes were for the moſt part ſtifnecked &amp; vncircumciſed in hart. &amp; if they had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of beleving Iewes that were baptized by Ioh. or Chr. diſciples- (by your doctryne the infants were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready baptized) what need was ther to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Chr. except it were for popish confirmation? &amp; ſo hence you cannot conclude baptiſme. I avouch conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly againſt you that either they were not the children of Iewes: or that they were not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of beleving Iewes or if their pare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts beleved, yet it followeth not that therfor theſe infants were of the Kingdom of God, or to be baptized: for Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> doth not ſay, of theſe, but, of ſuch is the Kingdom of God: &amp; ſo he doth expound himſelf Mat. 18 3-6. beſides how can you prove that by the Kingdome of God Chr. vnderſtandeth the viſible church of the new Teſt. or how can you prove that Chr. bleſſeth none but members of the viſible Chur? or how can you prove that the bleſſing of Abraham aperteyneth only to the members of the viſible church? or that from this particular of Chr. praying for infants Mat. 18.13. baptiſing of infants followeth? or how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26301:11"/> prove that Chriſt obteyned for them, &amp; prayed for remiſſion of ſinnes, the H, ghoſt, faith, everlaſting life? for many were brought to Chr. for releef of bodily infirmityes.</p>
               <p>Secondly: I deny that, bicauſe Chriſt bleſſed ſome of the infants of the Iewes or Gentils vppon ſpecial intreaty, therefore it may hence be concluded that generaly the covenant &amp; ſeales of the covenant (as you cal baptiſme) doth aperteyne to them: for ther is not the ſame reaſon of al infants, as of ſome ſpecialy bleſſed: as of Iohn Baptiſt, Ieremy, Sampſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly if baptiſme doth aperteyne to infants bicauſe Chr. bleſſeth ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar infants, &amp; bicauſe Chr. ſaith the Kingdom of God doth aperteyne to ſuch, then the L. ſupper alſo: for if you ſay, they are not capable of the L. ſupper in two reſpects: 1. for that they cannot eate it, 2. for that they cannot examine themſelves: I answer they muſt have it aſſoone as they can eate it: &amp; they cannot confeſſe their ſinnes &amp; faith, &amp; ſo cannot be baptized.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: I would know why the Apo. put infants back, &amp; why Chr. did not com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maund them to be baptized: Surely, if they had been the infants of belevers, or if the Apo. had known Chr. mynd for baptiſme of infants he having ſo fit an opportunity would have put it in practiſe: but the deep ſilence of baptiſme in this place where ther is ſo juſt an occaſion doth inſtruct vs evidently that Chr. either did not deale faithfully which to ſay were blaſphemy, or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> he never purpoſed the baptiſme of infants.</p>
               <p>You ſee therfor by that which hath bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwered that both your major &amp; minor are weak &amp; the Scriptutes alledged by you do not confirme them: for the place 1. Cor. 3.21.22. declareth that al things are yours: that is theirs that actually beleeve &amp; are baptized: &amp; al the ordinances of the viſible church are theirs both in title vſe &amp; poſſeſſion: So that hence you muſt nedes prove if your arg be good that infants muſt have the vſe of al: only your caution helpeth you, viz: that they may pertake ſo many meanes as they are capable of: but wher is this caution expreſſed in al the ſcriptures do you think that the members of the Church are not capable of al the meanes of ſalvation? but I avouch vnto you that this place perteyneth only to baptiſed perſons not to perſons vnbaptized, &amp; therfor it fitteth not your purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Rom. 9.4. The covenants &amp; promiſes perteyne to the Iſraelites: I deny the word aperteyneth, it is put into the Text, &amp; perverteth the meaning of the Apo. For Paull intendeth not to prove that the carnal Iſraelites were al actually within the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of grace &amp; ſalvation by Chr. being really poſſeſſed of it, but that vnder the outward covenant &amp; promiſe wherof they were really ſeaſed, the Spiritual covenant &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was offered &amp; preſented vnto them, the one preaching the other, the law being a ſcholemr. to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wheras in the answer of an objection you intimate that infants now are as capable of baptiſme as infants were of circumciſion, being both equaly capable of the covenant &amp; ſeales, I answer: that baptiſme is not the ſeale of the covenant of the new Teſt. as circumciſion was the ſeale of the old Teſt. &amp; that infants of the old Teſta. were capable of circumciſion abſolutely ſeing that to be circumciſed ther was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing required but a foreskinne apt to be cut of: but to baptiſme in the new Teſt. ther is required actual ſaith &amp; repentance confeſſed by the mouth, Mat. 3.6.

               <p>Touching the former propoſition. I take it, that none wil affirme holines in any that are not of the covenant, for in that reſpect, Iſrael was called a holy nation. Exo. 19.6.1. Pet. 2.9. &amp; al others vncleane, Act. 11.3. &amp; 10.15. that were without. Iff in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants be within the covenant, then can not the ſeal be denyed to ſuch, ſeing the Lo. hath joyned the promiſe &amp; ſeale together, Gen. 17.10. which no man may or ought to Seperate, Mat. 19.6.</p>
               <p>What can be objected againſt the aſſumption, I ſee not, ſeing the Apoſtle plainly affirmes, but now are your children holy. Vnleſſe it may be ſaid, as of ſome I have heard, that as the vnbeleeving wyfe is ſanctified to the husband, ſo are the children viz: to the vſe of their Father: but this to affirme is a great abuſing of the Scripture. For the Apoſtle in that place answering an objection that the Faithful is defiled by the ſociety of the vnfaithful: proveth that the faithful husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vſe the veſſel of his vnfaithful wife, by an argument from the effects, namely bicauſe their children, which are borne of them, are accounted holy or within the promiſe, God having ſaid to al the Faithful, I wil be thy God, &amp; the God of thy ſeed. As for that other ſtraunge expoſition, that the Children of a beleeving Father are no otherwiſe ſanctified then the vnbeleeving wife is vnto her husband, viz: to their Fathers vſe only, that cannot ſtand with the meaning &amp; purpoſe of the Apoſt. For ſo much may be ſaid of an vnbeleeving ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he is for the vſe of his maſter to do him ſervice: if children be no more holy then ſo, then have they no prerogative in being the children of a beleeving Father, neither is the objection removed by this answer.</p>
               <p>If it bee further preſſed that the vnbeleving wife is ſaid to be holy, as wel as the children, yet is she not within the covenant. I answer, that she indeed is not holy, as be her children, for she being an infidel is without Gods covenant, &amp; therfor she is ſaid to be ſanctified in her husband, the Apoſtle reſpecting their mariage, which though it was contracted before either party beleeved, yet ſtands firme &amp; not diſſol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved when either of them is called to the Faith, ſo that the beleeving husband may lawfully vſe her as his wife, if she be content to dwel with him, 1. Cor. 7.12. Now the children cannot be ſanctified or Seperate to ſuch vſe to their Father, as the wiſe is to her husband. And therfor are the children called holy, bicauſe they are the ſeed of a beleeving Father.</p>

               <p>Finally, the whole diſputation of Paul to the Romanes &amp; Galatians concerning juſtification by Faith in Chriſt without the workes of the Law doth evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this excellent truth. Teaching that ſeing the vtmoſt obedience of the Law did not effect or produce juſtification, therfor of neceſſity it followeth that the Law or old Teſtament did not preſuppoſe it, or true holines in the members therof: For it had been a vanity to have given them a Law which should not or could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve &amp; produce that which was in them in ther firſt conſtitution: wherfor I doe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26301:14"/> bouldly defend againſt all men, that the Church of the Old Teſtament in the matter or conſtitution of it was not really Holy, but only Typically: &amp; therfor the members therof admitted in by circumciſion were not truly holy or ſanctified, or in actual poſſeſſion of that everlaſting covenant which God made with Abraham in reſpect of Chriſt: but only vnder the offer of it in that typical Teſtament given to Abraham, &amp; afterward aſſumed written &amp; amplified by Moſes, Ioh. 7.19-23. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Heb. 8.8.9.</p>
               <p>Having ſufficiently confirmed this truth, I returne in particular to answer your objections ſaying ſtil that the nation of the Iewes was holy, not truly but typically &amp; that their holines was this, that by that external covenant whereinto they were by circumciſion admitted, they were trayned vp, or Schooled to Chriſt, being by all the ceremonial law &amp; old Teſtament, or carnal commaundement, as it were by ſo many meanes conſecrated or dedicated to that holy cad &amp; purpoſe, which was tiped &amp; shadowed by thoſe figures &amp; ſimilitudes of heavenly things. Therfor as the word ſanctifying or hallowying is vſually taken in the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the ſetting of any thing apart to a holy vſe: ſo were the people of Iſrael holy: even an holy natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> above al the nations of the Earth, See: Exod. 19.10.14.15. Iob. 1.5. Deu. 14.1-4. compared with Act. 21.28. &amp; for the place which you aledg, Ex. 19.6. to prove the Iſraelites an holy nation, I ſay, that either the meaning is that they were typically, holy, trayned vp to holines, or that they by attayning the end of the law should attayne true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines in Chriſt: So that this place is nothing to your purpoſe of the holines of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal covenant which God made with Abraham: So that though infants be vnder offer of the covenant made with Abraham in reſpect of Chriſt, yet shal not baptiſme be adminiſtred vppon them, as your conſequent doth import, bicauſe that in the old Teſtament none were circumciſed but thoſe that were actually feaſed vppon that external covenant: &amp; therefore none in the New Teſtament shalbe baptized but thoſe that are actually poſſeſſed of the covenant of the New Teſtament: but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual poſſeſſion of the promiſe is by obedience to the Faith: For by Faith (ſaith the Apoſtle. Gal. 3.14.) we receave the promiſe of the Spirit, &amp; we receave the Spirit by the hearing of Faith preached, Gal. 3.2. &amp; Faith cometh by hearing of the word prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched, Rom. 10.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer concerning the conſequent of your Majors conſequent that it shal not follow that bicauſe children are vnder the covenant (as you ſuppoſe, but we deny) that therfor they thal have the outward ſigne or ſeale therof: for you know vnder the law the females were actually vnder the covenant of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; yet were not ſigned with the ſeale: &amp; before the law was given al that were actualy vnder the covenant vntil the tyme of Abraham had no external ſigne or ſeale therof. if you ſay in oppoſition to the circumciſion of the female that she was vncapable of it: I anſwer the L. had abundance of Spirit, &amp; if it had been his wil that al vnder the covenant should be pertakers of the ſigne or the ſeale therof, he could in wiſdom &amp; would vndoubtedly have appointed ſuch an external ſigne or ſeale that might have bene adminiſtred vppon al vnder the covenant, but ſeing the L. choſe out the male only for circumciſion, the by he purpoſed to teach in a type that only the male (that is, one that is in Chriſt) shalbe ſealed with the Spirit of promiſe vnder the new Teſt.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26301:14"/> But if you ſay in opoſition to that before the Law, that ther was no ſeale or ſigne ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed by God for them vnder the covenant, bicauſe the L. thought it not meet or needful. I ſay that herby it apeareth that, to be vnder the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was not the cauſe of title to the ſeale, but the particular expreſſe commaundement or wil of God: &amp; ſo the inſufficiency of your conſequent appeareth, which importeth that to bee vnder the covenant is reaſon ſufficient to prove a partie to be intitled to the ſeale or ſigne of the covenant: &amp; this excellent truth herby is manifeſted, that if it should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that infants were actualy vnder the covenant yet it could not follow thervppon that therfor they should have the ſigne of ſeale of the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which you ſay is bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme, except it could be proved by expreſſe commaundement otherwiſe: for this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument you ſee proveth it not: Hence therfor apeareth the weaknes of your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, viz: that if infants were holy, &amp; ſo vnder the covenant, yet it doth not follow that therefor they shall have the ſigne or ſeale of the covenant which (you ſay, but we deny) is baptiſme.</p>
               <p>But I paſſe vnto your aſſumption: which you ſay is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, 1. cor. 7.14. but now are your children holy: you affirme that infants of one of the parents Faithful are holy: I except many things here firſt: I deſire that you expound vnto me what this holines is which the Ap. here mentioneth: happily you wil ſay it is to be vnder the covenant, then I demaund what it is to be vnder the covenant? prehaps you wil ſay (though this be to runne in a circle) it is to be juſtified by imputation of Chr. righteoſnes. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I demaund which of theſe three, viz. to be holy, to be vnder the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to have Ch. righteouſnes imputed, is firſt in nature? happily you wil ſay: Firſt, they are vnder the covenant. Secondly, they are juſtified by the imputed righteouſnes of Chr. Thirdly they are ſanctified or holy. Then I proceed, &amp; demaund when do infants come vnder the covenant: when they are conceaved: or when they are borne? or when the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are converted being already borne? It wilbe anſwered: That theſe infants that are begotten of Faithful parents come vnder the covenant in their conception: &amp; theſe infants that are already borne come vnder the covenant when their parents are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate: hereby then it appeareth that the covenant is conveighed to the children from the parents by generation, &amp; by filial relation: herevnto add that if it be true that ſome ſay, that children vnder the government of the faithful alſo are vnder the covenant, that the covenant is conveighed alſo by pupilship or adoption &amp; if bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves or ſervants being infants be vnder the covenant bicauſe of their beleving Mrs. then ſervitude is alſo a meanes or inſtrument of conveigning the covenant from Mr. to Servants: this being propounded then as the truth you hold, that plead for Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme, then you maintayne, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>: &amp; I ſay that infants of parents &amp; Mrs. cannot bee admitted, bicauſe of their want of Faith being vnder yeeres: but it wilbee ſaid that the covenant with Abraham was with him &amp; his ſeed only: I ſay, that it was made (by your confeſſion) with him and his adopted infants, with him &amp; his pupils being infants, with him &amp; his Servants being infants: &amp; therfor not only with him &amp; his ſeed: &amp; ſeing ſome not of his ſeed may be admitted into the covenant, &amp; thoſe that are further of, why shall not thoſe that are neerer as his wife: but you wil ſay bicauſe infants do not refuſe the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they may be admitted to baptiſme, though adopted childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though pupils, though Servants: but wives refuſing the covenant may not: I further inſiſt that as infants do not reſiſt, ſo they do not conſent: &amp; that al the Children, Servants, &amp; Wives, that do not reſiſt, may bee admitted, though they cannot make declaration of their Fayth &amp; repentance: if you ſay: not ſo: bicauſe that in them that are of yeers Faith &amp; repentance is required, but of infants no ſuch thing is required: I answer, firſt shew that by Scripture, &amp; then I ſay ther is no reaſon why Faith &amp; repentance should bee required of one to make him capable of the covenant of juſtification, &amp; Sanctification more then of another, except you wil ſay that God is accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: &amp; further the covenant is only with Abraham &amp; his ſeed, not with his adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Children, not with his pupils, not with his Servants, &amp; therfor in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Faith and repentance muſt neceſſarily be had, &amp; ſo they cannot bee baptized til they shew their Faith &amp; repentance which is contrary to your doctryne: beſides you cannot shew in al the Scriptures that perſons may be ſaid to be partakers of the covenant actually, except actually they fulfil the condition of the covenant: &amp; if you ſay that infants being vnder the covenant, juſtified, &amp; ſanctified, therfor they have Fayth &amp; the graces of God in them, I ſay that is contrary to the Scriptures which ſay that Faith commeth by hearing: &amp; that the word is the immortal ſeed of regeneration, wherby new borne babes vnder the goſpel are regenerate: &amp; if it be ſaid that infants have a kind of Faith wrought in them inviſibly, &amp; after an hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manner: I ſay what God worketh inviſibly, &amp; ſecreatly we diſpute not nor regard, but what he worketh viſibly &amp; to our knowledg, &amp; by the meanes appointed for the communion of the Church: For ther is but one Faith, which is the common Faith of the members of the Church, which is viſibly ſeen by ſpeaking &amp; confeſſion, according as it written I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leeved &amp; therfor I ſpeake, Tit. 1.4. &amp; if it be objected that then wee doe condemne al infants dying before they be converted: I ſay No: wee pronounce nothing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but leave the ſecreat of them to the Lord, who hath reſerved ſecreat things to himſelf: Hence then I conclude that ſeing you cannot declare what this holines is which infants have, ſeing they cannot have actuall holynes: Seing you cannot declare that they have Faith or juſtification, ſeing they cannot have actuall Fayth: Therfor you cannot declare that they are actually vnder the covenant, by actuall Faith &amp; holines: &amp; ſo if they bee not actually vnder it, but vnder the offer of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26301:15"/> it onely, that is it which wee affirme, &amp; which wil help you nothing to baptiſme of infants.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deſire that you would prove vnto me by Scripture, that in this place. 1. Cor. 7.14. Holines ſignifieth true ſanctification, or to be actually vnder the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, having it really inveſted vppon them, You endevour to declare it out of the text: For you ſay Paul anſwereth an objection, viz, that the faithful are defiled with the Society of the vnfaithful, &amp; proveth that the Faithful husband may vſe the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his vnfaithful wiſe with a good conſcience by an argument drawne from the effects, namely, bicauſe their Children are holy, &amp; vnder the covenant: God having ſaid to the Faithful I wilbe thy God, &amp; the God of thy ſeed. Wel, let vs ſee the force of your reaſon: your fourth argument was this.</p>

               <p>Thirdly I answer that (Holy) doth not ſo ſignify as you expound, neither is the argument taken from the effects, but from the greater to the leſſe after this manner.</p>

               <p>And whereas you ſay that by this expoſition an vnbeleving ſervant is in as good an eſtate, &amp; as holy as children in reſpect of the covenant, I confeſſe it to be ſo: &amp; you that plead for pedobaptiſme ſay ſo likewiſe, ſeing that you wil have ſervants vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der the covenant by their Mrs. Faith: but I would know whither the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth only of infants or of al Children generally: if generally of al Children, then all the Children of the Faithful are holy, yea even thoſe that are vnbeleevers &amp; then would I know how vnbeleeving children can be holy, if not as the vnbeleving wife is holy: that is to the vſe of their parents in the relative dutyes of children &amp; parents. If the Apoſtle ſpeaketh only of infants, then he ſpeaketh not ſo generally as God ſpeake to Abraham ſaying I wilbe thy God, &amp; the God of thy ſeed, for in that ſpeech you ſay al the ſeed is comprehended whither of yeeres or vnder yeeres, yea ſervants, pupils, children by adoption, &amp;c. So that expound it as you wil, it cannot be vnderſtood of holines in reſpect of the covenant as you pretend: but you wil ſay
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26301:16"/> they are to bee eſteemed Holy &amp; vnder the covenant til they manifeſt the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: &amp; I ſay, that they muſt manifeſt that they are Holy before they can bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Holy: &amp; that you cannot prove that aſſertion from the Scripture: &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes Abrahams carnall Children were Holy when they declared the contrary by their ſinnes, Exo. 19.6. compared with Exod. 32.9. &amp; 33.3.5, ſo are the children of the Faithful holy though they be vnbeleevers as the wife is holy though an vnbeleever.</p>
               <p>Finally you ſay: God hath ſaid to all the Faithful, I wilbe thy God &amp; the God of thy ſeed: I deny it vtterly: God ſaid that only to Abtaham, Geneſ. 17.7. &amp; whither you expound it literally, or Spiritually, I avouch confidently againſt you &amp; al men that the meaning of it is not, that God made his covenant with the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, or the Faythful woman &amp; their infants begotten of their Bodyes: but that literally the meaning is, I willbe God vnto thee Abraham &amp; thy ſeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh to give them the Land of Canaan: &amp; ſo it is expounded Geneſ. 17.8. Or Spiritually the meaning is, I wil give vnto Abraham the Father of the Faithful, &amp; al that are his Spiritual ſeed, everlaſting life, which is the true Land of Canaan: The latter which is the truth being ſignified by the former which is the type: &amp; shew mee in all the Scriptures that God ſaid to every Faithful man &amp; woman (for you muſt prove it ſpoken of women aswel as men) that he will be God vnto them &amp; their ſeed: For I would fayne know why the covenant should paſſe vnto the infants of the Faithful: it wilbe ſaid bicauſe of the Fathers Faith: this is falſe doctryne: For the Prophet teacheth that every man shal live by his owne faith &amp; that one mans faith ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not conveigh the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another neither can one mans ſin cut of another from the covenant as this doctrine importeth: but the ſoule that ſinneth it shal dye.</p>
               <p>Neither wil it avayle to plead that the covenant made with Abraham was an everlaſting covenant. For berith gnolam in the original doth not import a covenant of everlaſting continuance, but a covenant that doth continue his proper tyme: For gnolam ſignifieth any hidden tyme, or any ſet tyme of any length, as 50. yeeres the tyme of the jubile: But let it be graunted that the covenant made with Abraham, Gen. 17.7. was the everlaſting covenant made with Abraham in reſpect of Chriſt, (which yet I do not ſee proved) what then shal it follow that bicauſe it was with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham &amp; the Faithfull whither Iewes or Gentils beleeving actually as Abraham the Father did: Therfor it is made with the Faithful men who is the child of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: &amp; with his children begotten of his body which have not Abrahams actuall Faith, &amp; ſo are not the children of Abraham: I deny it vtterly: For the Apoſtle ſaith the ſeed is but one to whome the promiſes were made, viz: Chriſt or the actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: For Chriſt dwelleth in the harts of men by Faith onely. Gal. 3.16. Eph. 3.17. But if it bee made with the Faithful who beleeve actualy which is one ſeed whither Iew or Gentil, &amp; the infants of the Faithful carnally begotten of their body, which is another ſeed, (for they are not begotten of the immortall ſeed of regeneration:) then the covenant is made with the ſeedes which are many : &amp; that is directly contrary the Apoſtles wordes, Gall, 3.16. Therefore the one ſeed is perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually beleeving, &amp; actually juſtified by the righteouſnes of Fayth, as Abraham the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26301:16"/> Father of al the Faithful was, Roman. 4.11. whence this Argument may bee framed.</p>

               <p>The depriving of our Children of the Sacrament, is to shorten the Lords bounty towards his people of the New Teſtament, that being denyed to their children, which God gave to his people, &amp; to their infants vnder the Law, is to deny them (in regard of their ſeed) the like aſſurance &amp; comfort, which the Iſraelites had of theirs.

               <p>Your 5. argument is taken from 1. Cor. 10.1.2. framed thus.</p>
               <p>If the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Iſraelites were baptized in the cloud &amp; in the ſea, aſwel as their parents, what letteth the infants of beleving parents vnder the goſpel to be likewiſe partakers of baptiſme aſwel as they?</p>
               <p>The former the Apoſtle affirmeth, 1. Cor. 10.1.2. &amp; therfor good warant muſt be shewed that our infants are cut of from this priviledg that the Iewes children had: that baptiſme being a type of our baptiſme,</p>
               <p>To this argument I make anſwer: by framing the like argument.</p>
               <p>If their infants did eate the ſame Spiritual meate &amp; drink which the parents did eate: then why may not our infants being able to eate &amp; drinck, eate &amp; drinck the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>The former the Apoſtle affirmeth, 1. Cor. 10.1.2. &amp; therfor good warrant muſt be shewed that our infants are cut of from the priviledg: &amp; thoſe ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were types of our Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Againe, I anſwer more properly thus: That ther shalbe a proportion betwixt the Type &amp; the truth, that baptiſme of the cloud &amp; ſea, &amp; our baptiſme, viz: that as yong &amp; old carnal Iſraelites were baptized in the cloud &amp; ſea, ſo yong &amp; old Spiritual true Iſraelites shalbe baptized by the baptiſme of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance: &amp; as the carnal parents with their carnal children were baptized in type: So Spiritual parents with their Spiritual children, that is ſuch as are regenerate by the word &amp; Spirit, shall bee baptized with the baptiſme of repentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes, which is baptiſme in truth.</p>
               <p>Further I ſay: That our infants shal have a priviledg fair greater then the infants of the Iſraelites had in that typical baptiſme: For they by it were only baptized into Moſes &amp; the Law: That by it they might learne Moſes, &amp; in Moſes the truth in Chr. as it were vnder a vele: but our infants vnder the goſpel shal have the dayly inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; education of Faithful parents, which is infinitely ſuperior to that darke peda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gogical baptiſme, &amp; al the baptiſmes &amp; ordinances of the old Teſtament: Seing that with open face they may in the preaching of the goſpel ſee Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; not vnder the vele of Moſes.</p>
               <p>Moreover I deny that the baptiſme of the cloud &amp; ſea was a type of the external baptiſme of the new Teſtament, in the abſtract: but it was a type of our baptiſme in the concrete: that is the baptiſme of the cloud did Type out our baptiſme in the 3. parts therof, viz. 1. The baptiſme of the Spirit, 2. The declaration of Faith &amp; repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the antecedent of baptiſme with water, 3. The outward washing with water a manifeſtation of the foreſaid particulars: &amp; all theſe to bee conferred vppon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants proportionable to thoſe infants, that is, New borne babes in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And whereas you further alledg that if your infants bee not baptized, the Lords
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26301:17"/> bounty is shortned to vs &amp; our infants: our confort is diminiſhed in reſpect of our infants which they had in reſpect of theirs: &amp; the goſpel is not preached to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as it was to theirs: I answer that Gods bounty, our confort in reſpect of our infants, &amp; the preaching of the glad tydings of the goſpel is as large &amp; ample every way to our infants as to theirs: For Gods bounty of the actual exhibiting and fealing the everlaſting covenant to Abraham &amp; al his carnall infants was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Old Teſtament: Neither were the parents in circumciſing their infants comforted in the aſſured conferring of it vppon their infants: &amp; circumciſion did not ſo plainly preach Chriſt then as he is preached now to infants: but what could the preaching of Chriſt profit infants either then in types or now in truth? Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I think that the Lord ever intended to teach the infant any thing at that in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtant, but afterward hee was to learne that which the Schoolemr. circumciſion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Flesh taught him: viz: the circumciſion of the hart: &amp; if you ſay that ſo infants baptized are to be inſtructed, I anſwer, that in the New Teſtament by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme wee manifeſt what wee have, namely, the inward baptiſme, whereas in the Old Teſtament by circumciſion they learned what they had not but ought to have, viz: The inward circumciſion of the hart, &amp; mortification of the ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Flesh.</p>

               <p>The errors of this argument I wil diſcover in order: Firſt I deny that baptiſme is the ſeale of the covenant of the new Teſtament. Secondly I deny that circumciſion was the ſeale of that everlaſting covenant that was made with Abraham in reſpect of Chriſt: Thirdly, baptiſme therfor doth not ſucceed in the place of circumciſion, ther being only a chandg of the ceremony (as you pretend) the covenant being the ſame, theſe thre particulars are already proved. Fourthly I deny, that though Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham who had a ſpecial commaundement, did circumciſe his male infants, therefore Chriſtians vppon this general commaundement, Mat. 28.19. shall baptiſe their infants Fifthly, I ſay rather the contrary is hence proved, bicauſe Chriſt commaundeth to baptiſe only thoſe that are by teaching made Diſciples (for ſo the word matheteu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate ſignifieth) therfor infants are by expreſſe prohibition excluded, &amp; it is as if Chr. should ſay, I wil have you make them Diſciples &amp; baptiſe them that are made Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by teaching &amp; no other: &amp; ſo Chriſt expreſly excludeth infants. Laſtly, I deny that infants are capable of baptiſme, for they cannot confeſſe their faith &amp; their ſinnes, neither declare that they are baptized inwardly with the Spirit, &amp; ſo cannot outwardly by the baptiſme with water declare the ſame, but are in every reſpect vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able therto, &amp; vncapable thereof.</p>

               <p>I make answer to this argument confeſſing it wholy, but yet denying the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of your concluſion: For it doth not follow bicauſe al the howshold of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia &amp; the Gaylor were baptized, that therfor infants were baptized: you ſhal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> what exceptions I take.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay though infants are a part of the family when the family hath infants in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26301:19"/> it, yet it doth not follow that wherſoever ther is mention made of a Family, that therefore that Family had infants in it: except therefore it bee proved that the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, by this reaſon you might prove that Lydias Husband, &amp; the Gaylors wife, &amp; their children of 40 yeeres old, &amp; their Servants of 60. yeeres old, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. For al theſe are parts of a Family, yet I ſupoſe you wil not ſay they were al of them baptized, except you can prove, that Lydia had a Husband, or the Gaylor had a wife, or children of 40. &amp; ſervants of 60. yeeres old: your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therfor is weak preſuppoſing the thing that is in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it were yeelded that ther were infants in Lydias Family, &amp; in the Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, doth it therfor follow that they were baptized? nothing leſſe: &amp; that I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſay that to the baptiſing of the Gaylors wife, &amp; children of yeeres of diſcretion ther was neceſſarily required Faith &amp; repentance, or els they were not bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized: So ſay, I that bicauſe infants cannot beleeve &amp; repent, though they were in the Family yet shal they not be baptized: For ther is one conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> required for al per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons to be baptized.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay: that although it be ſaid that al that perteyned to the Gaylor were bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized, yet it is alſo ſaid vſ. 32. That the word was preached to all that were in his howſe: &amp; vſ. 34. That al his howſehold beleeved, &amp; how came their faith but by the word preached vſ. 32. Seing therfor that al that were baptized in the Gaylors hows beleeved by the preaching of the word: infants that could not beleeve by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, were not baptized if he had any: beſides it was a mervailous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered tyme at midnight to wake children, &amp; to bring them before the Apoſtles for baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſay: That for Lydias Family it is not ſaid that all her howſehold was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: or if it had been ſo ſaid, yet it followeth not that every particular perſon off her Family was baptized. For Mat. 3, 5.6. it is ſaid that al Iudea went out to Iohn &amp; were baptized of him, confeſſing their ſinnes: yet hence it cannot bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all &amp; every one that went out were baptized: or that all &amp; every one went out to bee baptized: no more can it bee proved that bicauſe it is ſaid that Lydias Family was baptized, that therefore all &amp; every particular perſon was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but as Mat. 3.6. only they that confeſſed ther ſinnes: &amp; as Act. 16.32-34. onley they that beleeved by the word preached were baptized, ſo was it with them of Lydias Family that were baptized: For the Apoſtles I doubt not kept one order, &amp; required the ſame conditions in al that they baptized: So that by that which hath been ſaid the vanity of this argument is manifeſted: &amp; it is proved plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that none were baptiſed in the Gaylors Family, but only they that beleved after the word preached &amp; ſo infants ſpecially are exempted, if he had any in his family which yet is not manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Hence therfor I reaſon thus againſt baptiſing infants.</p>

               <p>Anſwere.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this reaſon being brought into forme wil be wray the weakenes of it: For ſuppoſe that should be graunted that there were nether a ſpecial commaundement or example in the practiſe of Iohn or Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And this may be done by good warrant from the example of our Saviour Chriſt, Mat. 22.31.32. wher reaſoning againſt the Saduces concerning the reſurrection, proves it by an argument neceſſarily drawen from Exo. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After the ſame manner doth Paul in his Epiſt. to the Romanes &amp; Gal. prove juſtification by Faith onely without works of the law this he did not prove by alledging any place in al the old Teſtament in plaine termes affirming ſo much, but by concluſions of neceſſary conſequence from the Scriptures. &amp; to this purpoſe might divers other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be aledged. So likewiſe if we prove the baptiſing of infants by vnanſwerable arguments out of the Old &amp; New Teſtament (though we cannot shew any playne precept or example,) yet may we vppon warrant thereof, not feare to baptiſe them. For the author of this reaſon him ſelfe cannot deny, that both he &amp; we muſt beleve diverſe things which wee gather out of the Scriptures by neceſſary conſequence,

Secondly, alſo if this argument be ſufficient to barre children from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of baptiſme, then is it as ſufficient to kepe back women from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for there is no ſpeciall precept, nor yet example that VVomen should pertake of the Lords Supper, but the Lawfullnes there of is onely proved by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, bicauſe they are within the covenant, &amp; are pertakers of the Sacrament of baptiſme, thus the weakenes of this reaſon being manifeſted, I will thirdly anſwere vnto it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, that ther is both precept by Chriſt &amp; example by his Diſciples for the baptiſing of infants as hath bene proved by my two laſt reaſons alledged to prove the Lawfullnes of baptiſing of infants: Commaundement, I ſay, Mat. 28.19.

                  </gap>nd vs &amp; our infants to receave this ſeale of the covenant. And as for examples we read that the Apoſtle baptized Lydia &amp; her howshold. Act. 16.15, &amp; the Keper, &amp; al that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto him, vſ. 33. both which ſeming to be great Families, it is not likely that they were without children, though the Evang: mention them not.</p>
               <p>But the exception is that only ſuch as did confeſſe their ſinnes, &amp; confeſſe their Faith, were baptized. I deſire that to be proved that only ſuch &amp; no others were to be baptized. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Iohn, indeed he was ſent to cal the people to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, &amp; ſo to prepare the way of the L. Mat. 3.3. &amp; ſo many as did repent &amp; confeſſe their ſinnes he baptized, but did Iohn refuſe their children if they brought them to him? but it wil be ſaid, ther is no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made that he did baptiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no more ſay I, is ther that they were offered vnto him. Ther is no mention that the Diſciples of Chr. were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, &amp; yet it were to bold a part, &amp; no doubt very falſe to affirme that they were not baptized: Not al things that Iohn did, not yet that Chr. did, in the particulars, are written Ioh. 20.30. but the ſume therof. &amp; therfor to gather an argument fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, bicauſe ther is no mention that children were baptized by Iohn, therfor they ought not to be baptized is a larger concluſion, then the premiſſe wil beare. &amp; ſo the reaſon taken from the baptiſing of the Evnuch, (Philip baptized no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Evnuch) is of no waight, to prove that therfor childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Was not the Evnuch a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger far from his country, now in jorney homeward &amp; therfor not likely that he should have children with him ſpecially in ſuch a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jorney, &amp; not knowing of this accident.</p>

               <p>Firſt, you ſay that a conſequence neceſſarily drawne from the Scripture is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove the baptiſing of infants, though ther were no ſpecial commaundement or example: as Chriſt proveth the reſurrection, Mat. 22.31.32, out of Exod. 3.6. by neceſſary conſequent &amp; as Paul in the Epiſtles to the Rom. &amp; Gal. proveth juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith only without workes, by neceſſary conſequents: &amp; wee beleeve many things that are not expreſſed in words: as 3. perſons in one Godhead, &amp; that Chriſt is coeſſential or conſubſtantial to the Father: this is your anſwer or exception: wher to I reply thus.</p>

Cor. 3.18. &amp; whereas you would fetch arguments from the old Teſtament to prove the baptiſme of infants, we having the cleer light of the new Teſtament, you therin ſet vs to Schoole to the rudiments of the world, &amp; put aſide the light of the ſunne at noone, &amp; ſet vp a candle as the Papiſts do in their funerals: for although it be meet that we attend vnto the Prophets as vnto a light shining in a dark place, yet ſeing the day ſtar is come, &amp; the ſunne of righteouſnes is riſen vppon vs, let vs walk in this cleer light, &amp; vſe the other when we want light, as with the Iewes who deny the new Teſtament: &amp; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like occaſions.</p>
               <p>Beſides the trinity of perſons, &amp; vnity of eſſence in the Godhead is proved by playne words, 1. Iohn. 5.7. &amp; hereby the Homoiouſia of Arrius is confuted: as alſo: Phil. 2.6. &amp; for the word perſon it is, Heb. 1.3. &amp; the word God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is Roman. 1.20. So that hereby you gett nothing: but I ſay ſtill that whatſoever cannot bee playnly shewed in the New Teſtament, is not needfull for vs to know in the New Teſtament, if it bee an ordinance of the New Teſtament as baptiſme is: but the trinity &amp; vnity is no part of the New Teſtament more then of the Old Teſtament, &amp; being common to both may be ſought out of both, &amp; ſo any other common truth.</p>
               <p>Finally, I ſay shew mee any neceſſary conſequence for baptizing infants, eyther out of the Old Teſtament or New Teſtament, &amp; I yeeld: but I deſire it may wel bee obſerved, firſt, that you are driven to conſequents for this matter, &amp; therein ſimple witted people may eaſily bee miſlead by a Logician: Secondly, that the Goſpel of Chriſt is for babes: Mat. 11.25. &amp; therefore the moſt ſimple perſon is, capable of it: &amp; ſo ther shal need no obſcure conſequents out of it for they are not able to comprehend them: &amp; laſtly, that the conſequents that are brought I avouch to be meer hallucinatious &amp; ſophiſmes, as I have already declared &amp; shal doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after more fully as they shal be produced.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26301:23"/> barre infants from baptiſme, it shal alſo barre weomen from the Lords Supper: I deny it, for in playne termes it is ſaid: 1. Corinth. 11.28. Let Anthropos, viz: ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or woman eate after examination: &amp; Gal. 3.28. Ther is neither male nor female in Chriſt Ieſus, but al are one, &amp; 1.

               <p>Your third answer &amp; exception followeth, wherein you doe affirme that there is both precept &amp; example for baptiſing infants, the Commaundement is, Mat, 18.19. The example is of the infants of Lydra, &amp; the Keper of the priſon: Act. 16.15.33. To theſe I have already given answer in the 6. &amp; 7. reaſons going before, &amp; therefore hold it needles to repeat it heer againe: onely one thing is heer to bee answered that you object. viz: That the Law once given of ſealing the infants as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel as parents, muſt bee retayned, except a repeale can bee shewed: I answer, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that baptiſme is not the ſeale of the New Teſtament, but the Spirit: &amp; that circumciſion was not a ſeale of the everlaſting covenant made with Abraham in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt but of the Old Teſtament) that when Princes &amp; common wealths make Lawes to endure but for a tyme, when the tyme is expired then they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed if they be not reeſtablished: So, though it were graunted that infants of the Old Teſtament were by circumciſion ſealed to the covenant made in reſpect of Chr. which I peremptorily deny, yet ſeing the tyme of circumciſion is exſpired therfor in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fants are not now to be ſealed (as you ſay) by baptiſme: for the exſpiring of the tyme is the repealing of the Law: therfor vntil you can shew that baptiſme of infants male &amp; female is in the new Teſtament eſtablished: I wil deſend that they are not to be baptized eſpecialy the female infants which were never appointed to be circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſed: but I count theſe but ſlender exceptions.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place you require proof that only perſons that confeſſed their ſinnes &amp; their faith were to be baptized: I prove it vnto you thus.</p>
               <list type="syllogism">

               <p>You ſay further that the reaſon why Iohn baptized no children, is for that they offered them not. wel: I ſay that his preaching was ſuch as peremptorily excluded in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fants: For it was the baptiſme of repentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes: Marc. 1.4. &amp; he required confeſſion of ſinnes, &amp; repentance of them that he baptized, Mat. 3.6-11 compared with Luk. 7.29.30. otherwiſe he would not baptiſe them: &amp; therfor Chr doctryne is the ſame with Iohns, Mar. 1.15. both therby ſignified vnto their hearers. that whoſoever would be baptized &amp; enter into the Kingdome of God, muſt repent &amp; beleeve the goſpel: For being not regenerate (though they were Iewes, &amp; begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Faithful parents) yet they could not enter into the Kingdome of God, Ioh. 3.3.5. &amp; heer it would bee conſidered vnto whome Chriſt &amp; Iohn Baptiſt preached: did he not preach vnto the Iewes the Lords owne holy people: &amp; yet he ſaid repent &amp; beleeve: &amp; required of them amendement of life: Now if they had been truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in their comunion as is pleaded, Iohn needed not thus have preached, nor Chriſt have required ſuch conditions of them, but onely they might in few words have ſaid: come you Faithful &amp; beleeving Iewes, you &amp; all your infants be baptized at once: For baptiſme is for circumciſion: but Iohn ſaith, think not to ſay you have Abraham to your Father: &amp; Chriſt ſaith, you are of your Father the Devil: &amp; Iohn ſaith, the Lord wil purge his floore: wherby it is evident that the Iewes were not Faithful in their communion: &amp; that they perceaved plainly that ſeing repentance &amp; Faith were required by Iohn &amp; Chriſt particularly, which muſt bee declared by confeſſion, therefore it was in vayne for them to offer their infants whom they knew Iohn &amp; Chriſt would not baptiſe, but excluded from baptiſme by their doctryne.</p>
               <p>Againe, wheras you ſay ther is no mention made that Chriſts Diſciples were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, &amp; yet it were boldnes to affirme they were not baptized: &amp; ſo al Chriſts &amp; Iohns actions are not written but only the ſumme: &amp; therfor though it be not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that infants were baptized, yet in the ſumme it may be collected they were: I anſwere, for the Diſciples of Chriſt it is plaine they were baptized, Ioh. 4.1. &amp; Ioh. 1.35.40. &amp; for the ſumming &amp; particularizing of al Iohn Baptiſts or Chriſts actions, I ſay it was not needfull to ſet downe the particulars but the kinds: &amp; if ther had been any commaundement or example of baptizing any one infant, it had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, though it had not been mentioned how many particular infants: but as it fel out in circumciſion that one particular precept was ſufficient, though it were not written how many thowſand were circumciſed, ſo likewiſe of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>The next reaſon is this.</p>
               <p n="2">2, Bicauſe Chriſt commaunded to make Diſciples by teaching them &amp; then to baptiſe them, Matth. 28.19. Iohn. 4.1. But infants can not by Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne become Chriſts Diſciples. And ſo can not by the rule of Chriſt bee baptized.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtles were indeed commaunded to make Diſciples, &amp; to cal vnto the Faith &amp; fellowship of the Goſpel, not onely the Iewes, but the Gentils through out the world, Mat. 28, 19. &amp; gave them power to preach the Goſpel, which before had been preached to Abraham, Gal. 3.8. &amp; to baptiſe al that did receive it: &amp; thus we graunt that faith muſt go before baptiſme, in al ſuch as are to be made Diſciples, &amp; brought into the covenant of God: So went Faith before circumciſion, Abraham firſt beleeved, &amp; after was circumciſed, &amp; likewiſe muſt al they which with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enter into Gods covenant, firſt beleeve &amp; then be baptized as the Evnuch, Act. 8.37. Lydia. Act. 16.13. &amp; the Keper of the priſon, Act. 16.33. But when ſuch have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Faith, then are their infants &amp; howshold capable alſo of baptiſme as Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hams Family was of circumciſion, he beleeving the promiſes, Gen. 17. &amp; therfor it is written, that when God opened the hart of Lydia, that she did atend to the VVord that Paul preached, &amp; beleeved, not only the her ſelfe, but al her howshold were baptized, &amp; yet is ther no mention of the Faith of any of them, ſave of Lydias onely. &amp; ſo the Kep beleeving al his received baptiſme, &amp; this is proportionable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Abraham, whoſe Faith we find ſufficient to intereſt al his ſeed in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp; make them capable of the ſeale.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Chriſt taketh the ſame courſe (in giving out this commiſſion to his Diſciples, Mat. 28.19.) in bringing the Gentils into Gods covenant, that the L. tooke with Abraham, for making his covenant with him, that he should be the Father of many nations, &amp;c. He did not firſt commaund him to be circumciſed, but preached to him the goſpel or covenant. Gen. 17.1-8. &amp; he beleev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng was circumciſed &amp; his howshold So here is a commaundement, firſt, for the publishing of the Goſpel to them that were not in Chriſt, &amp; then for baptiſing ſuch as beleeved with theire Familyes, for that is included in this Commaundement, els had not the Apoſtle baptized the Familyes of Lydia, &amp; of the Kep. as before hath been: noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thirdly, if children shalbe excluded from baptiſme bicauſe they cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:26301:25"/> Diſciples by teaching, &amp; ſo beleeve, then by as good reaſon may they be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from ſalvation, for he that ſaith, he that beleeveth &amp; is baptized, shalbe ſaved, ſaith alſo, he that beleeveth not shalbe damned, Mar. 16.16. if therfor want of faith be ſufficient to exclude infants from baptiſme: then likewiſe the want of Fayth is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient to exclude them from Salvation, for if the former be held to be the meaning of Chriſt, then muſt the latter alſo bee graunted, a thought whereof is to bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hord.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, general rules muſt bee taken with theire ſence &amp; meaning. It is a generall rule given by the Apoſtle: 2. Theſſ. 3.19. That if any would not worke hee shousd not eate: yet if any should gather from hence that the impotent &amp; infants should not eate, bicauſe they doe not worke, this were to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp; to wreſt the Apoſtles doctryne: So Chriſt giving a general rule for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Diſciples, &amp; baptiſing them, now to deprive the infants of beleeving parents of baptiſme, bicauſe they cannot receive inſtruction, which is intended onely of them that bee capable thereof &amp; vnconverted, is to diminishe the commaundement of Chriſt, even like as hee that should ſay, infants cannot beleeve, &amp; therfor cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Againe, that can never be the true meaning of a Scripture whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is expounded ſo as it contradicteth other Scriptures, or any ſound concluſion gathered out of the Scriptures, as this expoſition of the Anabaptiſts vppon this place of Mat. 28.19. doth, as my formet reaſons for the baptiſing of infants, doe playnly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>

               <p>Next followeth your Anſwere to my ſecond reaſon: which reaſon of myne is framed thus.</p>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>They that cannot by Teaching bee made Chriſts Ciſciples, ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</item>
                  <item>Infants by teaching cannot be made Chr. Diſciples, Mat. 28.19. Ioh. 4.1. </item>
                  <item>Ergo infants ought not to be baptized.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Your anſwer to this argument of myne conſiſteth in 4. particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſay, that as Abraham firſt beleeved, &amp; then was circumciſed, &amp; then al his houshold receaved circumciſion with him: So al the beleving gentils muſt firſt be baptized, &amp; then through ther faith al ther howshold muſt bee baptized as in the example of Lydia, &amp; the Gaylors family: of whoſe faith ther is no mention made, as neither of the faith of Abrahams family.</p>
               <p>To this firſt particular of your anſwer I ſay, that you erre miſtaking the Scriptures For Abrahams faith did not go before his circumciſion as a neceſſary antecedent to eſtablish him a member of the Church of the old Teſtament, but as a neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, example, type, or paterne of juſtification: &amp; circumciſion in Abraham was not a ſeale of his juſtification, or of the everlaſting covenant God made with him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt, therby to eſtabliſh him into Chriſt, (for he was in Chriſt &amp; ſealed in Chriſt many yeres before, by the ſeale of the Spirit:) but Abrahams juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26301:25"/> in vncircumciſion, was a type of the juſtification of the Gentils who are vncircumciſed: &amp; Abrahams circumciſion alter his juſtification ſealed him vp to bee the Father of all the beleevers circumciſed: &amp; ſo circumciſion had a triple vſe in Abraham one generall &amp; two ſpeciall &amp; particular: the two ſpeciall are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt circumciſion ſealed vp Abrah. forme of juſtification to be a paterne to al the beleevers in vncircumciſion: that the beleeving gentils should be al juſtified by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faith, as he was.</p>
               <p>Secondly, circumciſion ſealed vp Abrah. forme of juſtification to bee a paterne to al the beleevers in circumciſion, that the beleving Iewes should be al juſtified by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual faith as he was.</p>
               <p>The general vſe of Abrah. circumciſion was common with him to Iſmael &amp; al the perſons of his family. &amp; al the carnal Iſraelites, viz: to ſeale him vp to the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; to the obſervation of the whole Law, wherby Chr. in that vele of the old Teſtament was preached vnto the Iewes, it being ther Schoolmr. to teach them Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now for the place. Rom. 4.11. which I am aſſured you wil ground your aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vppon, I ſay, it is both falſely tranſlated, &amp; expounded: for (tes en te acrobuſtia) is vſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally tranſlated which Abrah. had when he was vncircumcized: &amp; this I ſay is a falſe tranſlation: For this is the true tranſlation, viz: which (is or was or shalbe) in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion: meaning that circumciſion vppon Abrah. the Father of al the beleving Gentils was a ſeale of juſtification to al the vncircumciſion that beleeve: &amp; the end of his circumciſion is his Fatherhood of the Faithful: &amp; the righteouſnes of faith is not ſealed vp to Abrah. particular perſon, but to the vncircumciſed that beleve. &amp; that which was ſealed vp in ſpecial to Abrah. was his Fatherhood or preſidentship of juſtification: So that circumciſion in Abrah. was to eſtablish him the Father of the Faithful Gentils, &amp; his circumciſion doth teach the Gentils that if they wil partake Chr. they muſt by their actual faith apprehend Chriſts righteouſnes, as Abrah. their Father did, otherwiſe they cannot be juſtified, &amp; ſo Pauls intent is plainly proved, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, that al men muſt be juſtified by faith without the works of the law: &amp; this do I confidently affirme to be the true tranſlation &amp; expoſition, &amp; that the common acceptation &amp; tranſlation of the place is the mother of this hereſy of pedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry.</p>
               <p>Againe, al the perſons of Abrah Family were not circumciſed, bicauſe of Abrah. ſaith, but the males, al &amp; only the males, were circumciſed bicauſe of the ſpecial co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God: Gen. 17.10. the males being aſſumed as types for to teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> figuratively the male Ch. &amp; circumciſion of the hart by him &amp; the females were vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>circumciſed as they were alſo put out from being the matter of the burnt-offring (for the males only were offered in burnt-offring) to ſignifie that thoſe that had not the male Chr. in them were not fit eyther to be members of the church of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or to be ſacrificed vnto the L. Mal. 1.14. but if Ch. the male were in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther male or female in Chr. it was nothing: they were accepted, Gal. 3.28.</p>
               <p>Further you ſay that as it was with Abrah. &amp; his family in circumciſion, ſo was it with Lydia &amp; the Gaylor, &amp; their familyes in baptiſme that is not ſo: I shew the difference in divers particular.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:26301:26"/>1. They of Abrahams Family were circunciſed vppon particular precept in obedience of the Commaundement: Geneſ. 17.23. you cannot prove that the infants of Lydias &amp; the Gaylors family were baptized vpon particular precept, but only you ſay it, &amp; indevour to juſtifie it by the example of Abra. family: but if Abra. family be an example then you muſt bring a particular precept (as he had) for bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing infants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They that were males only were circumciſed, but you wil have both males &amp; females baptized: this is another difference.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that were circumciſed of Abrah. Family, were al the males being of yeres, though they were never ſo lewd &amp; wicked perſons: So were not al the perſons of Lydias &amp; the Gaylors family, but only the beleevers being of yeeres ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your opinion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As Faith did not intitle the female to circumciſion, &amp; as infidelity did not deprive the male of circumciſion in Abrahams Family: So faith did intitle the female to baptiſme in the Family of the Gaylor &amp; Lydia: &amp; infidelity in the male did exclude him from baptiſme: you ſee therfor that the proportion is not alike betwixt baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me &amp; circumciſion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular in your Anſwer to this Arg. is, that the ſame order is kept in Chr. comiſſion, Mat. 18.19. in bringing the gentils into Gods covenant, as was kept with Abtah: he &amp; al his Family were brought in by circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion, after the goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched to him. Geneſ. 17.1-8. ſo Lydia &amp; the Gaylor were brought into the covenant with all ther Family, &amp; were baptized after the Goſpell preached to them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that in this particular there are differences betwixt the one act of Abrah. &amp; the other of Lydia &amp; the Gaylor, according to the commiſſion of Chr. Mat. 28.19.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Abrah. &amp; al his family by the Lords commaundement, came vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Old Teſtament actually, &amp; the males only were circumciſed: but Chr. doth not commaund all perſons of a Family in the New Teſtament to be baptized, but only ſuch as are made Diſciples, &amp; al them though they bee weomen as Lydia was.</p>
               <p>Secondly: The goſpel was only preached to Abrah. owne perſon by the L. but in the Gaylors caſe Paul preached the goſpel to al that were in his howſe. Act. 16.32. &amp; ſo Chr. commaundeth to make them Diſciples by preaching: So were not Abrah. Family, who being firſt circumciſed afterward were taught the Law being a School <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to teach Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the goſpel was not preached to Abrah. therby to prepare him to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as if therby it should follow that circumciſion was a ſeale of the Goſpel or New Teſtament: for it is not ſo as I have already manifeſted but Chr. in the new Teſtament commaundeth the goſpel to be preached to every creature, that is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular perſon, that is to be admitted into the Church by baptiſme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> &amp; ſo Paul did to the Gaylors Family, &amp; this is another difference.</p>

               <p>Your laſt particular in the answer to my arg. is, that general rules muſt bee taken with ther ſence: as 2. Theſ. 3.10. that as infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or impotent perſons though they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now followes the third reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Bicauſe if infants be baptized, the carnal ſeed is baptized, &amp; ſo the ſeal of the covenant is adminiſtred to them, vnto whom the covenant aperteyneth not, Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Anſwere. </p>
               <p n="1">1. This reaſon ſemeth to imply, that the ſeed of the faithful is part carnal, &amp; part Spiritual, (for I cannot imagine that the Author holdeth al the ſeed of the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful to be carnal. &amp; that the covenant aperteynes not vnto any of them, ſeing ſo to affirme contradicts. Act. 2.39.) &amp; therfor bicauſe the Spiritual ſeed is not diſcerned vntil it manifeſt it ſelfe by outward profeſſion, therefore may not be baptized, leſt in baptiſing them, the ſeal should be ſet alſo vpoon the carnal ſeed, vnto whom belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs not the covenant. To affirme this firſt is to deny that which is due to the ſeed to whom the promiſe belongs, for the wickeds ſake, &amp; ſo to injurie them. Secondly, this reaſon alſo ſerves as wel againſt the circumciſion of the infants of the Iſraelites, ſeing at eight dayes of Age they could not be diſcerned, whether they were of the carnal or Spiritual ſeed, &amp; ſo the ſeale of the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to be adminiſtred to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom the covenant did not belong. But as then the not diſcerning hereof, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder circumciſion to bee adminiſtred to all the infants of the Iſraelites, no more now can the not knowing of the Spiritual ſeed from the carnall, hinder bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching the ſeed of the faithful, thus I conceive therof that it is carnall &amp; Spiritual in divers reſpects, carnal as they do naturally deſcend of their parents, ſo are they al alike in ſinne, Pſal. 51.3. Spiritual, in reſpect of the covenant wherein they are comprehended with their parents. Gen. 17.7. Act. 2.39. in which regard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, al the children of the Faithful are ſaid to be holy, 1. Cor. 7.14. &amp; thus conſidered I deny the children of the faithful to be carnal ſeed, &amp; do affirme that to ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the covenant &amp; the ſeale therof. &amp; though ſome of them in the right of God be known for none of his, yet to vs it ſufficeth for the adminiſtration of baptiſme, that they be the ſeed of the faithful: &amp; therfor as the Iſraelites circumciſed all their children, (though ſome of them proved to be carnal afterward, as Iſmael, Eſau, &amp;c.) ſo are wee to baptiſe al our infants, leaving ſecreete things to God, Deuteron. 29.29.</p>
               <p n="3">3, If this be ſufficient to cleere vs from profaning of the Sacrament if wee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them that make confeſſion of their faith, bicauſe they ſo doe, though they bee not the children of God, as S. Magus, Act. 8, 13. then is it not ſimply a profaning of baptiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, to adminiſter it to them vnto whome belongs not the covenant, but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne it to them which plainly appeare to vs to bee without: Therfore, if no man
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:26301:27"/> dare take vpon him to ſay this or that infant is carnall &amp; without the covenant of grace, it shalbe no profanation of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if it be adminiſtred vnto ſuch, ſeing we ought to hold the ſeed of the faithful, holy, 1. cor. 7.14. If it be objected (as ſome have done to me, that al the ſeed of the faithful are carnal, &amp; ſo to beheld vntil they beleeve &amp; make confeſſion of their faith. I anſwer, firſt, if they take carnal, as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the children of promiſe in Rom. 9.8. I vterly deny it, for the children of the Flesh can never be the children of promiſe, Rom. 9.8.13. Theſe two ſeeds are made ſo oppoſite by the Apoſtle, as that the one can never be the other. Secondly, if by carnal they meane nothing els, but that natural corruption wherein we are borne: That hinders infants no more from baptiſme, then it doth thoſe that can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their faith, ſeing natural corruption remaineth ſtil in the pureſt profeſſor, Rom. 7.23 &amp; if it be replyed, that their natural corruption is not imputed to them that beleeve, no more (ſay I) is it to infants, els Chriſt dyed not for them, neither could they be ſaved, dying whilſt they be yong.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if Abrah. knowing that God would eſtabliſh his covenant to Iſaac Geneſ. 17, 19. yet circumciſed Iſmael, vſ. 24. &amp; Iſaac knowing that God had choſen his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſonne, Gen. 25.23. with 27.33. yet circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed Eſau aswel as Iacob, &amp; in ſo doing neither of them profaned the Sacrament: much leſſe is baptiſme profaned, when it is adminiſtred to the ſeed of the faithful to whom belongeth the promiſe, Act. 2.39. And thus having shewed the weaknes of theſe 3. reaſons againſt the baptiſing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, let vs come to the ſecond poſition, which is this.</p>

                  </gap> warrant of Scripture: &amp; I deny that infants of the Faithful are to be conſidered in theſe two reſpects: &amp; whereas you bring two places Gen. 17.7. &amp; 1. Cor. 7.14. to prove the latter part of the diſtinction I have answered theſe two places already she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing your falſe expoſition of them, &amp; that the infants of Abraham were not in their byrth vnder the actual poſſeſſion of the everlaſting covenant made in reſpect of Chr. but only vnder the offer of it, &amp; that the infants &amp; al the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faithful are holy only as the wife that is an vnbeleever is holy: &amp; ſo this exception of yours is frivolous.</p>
               <p>The third particular you bring in answer to my reaſon, is, that it is not ſimply a profaning of the covenant to adminiſter the ſeale of it to them to whom it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not as to Simon Magus, Act. 8.13. but it is then profaned when it is adminiſtred to them that are wicked, &amp;c: I answer, the Sacrament of baptiſme is profaned when it is adminiſtred vppon a wrong ſubject whatſoever it bee: as to give the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to an infant of two yeer old So to baptiſe an infant is a profanation. For as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion &amp; confeſſion of Fayth shall intitle any man to all the ordinances of the Chur. &amp; firſt to baptiſme: So abſence of confeſſion of Faith shall debarre every one from all the ordinances of the Church in communion: &amp; although I will not ſay that Children are damned, yet I dare ſay that they are borne &amp; dead in treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; ſinnes, &amp; that they doe not nor cannot shew any ſparke of grace to mee, &amp; therfor although I dare not ſay this or that infant is not vnder the election of God, yet I dare ſay that never an infant in the Earth is actually ſeaſed of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is onely atteyned by confeſſion of ſinne &amp; Faith: For ſo ſaith Chriſt: the tyme is fulfilled, the Kingdome of God is at hand: repent &amp; beleeve the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: Marc. 1.15. &amp; except a man bee borne againe hee cannot ſee the Kingdome of God.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26301:29"/> lineally deſcend of Abrah. &amp; you ſay peremptorily that al that lineally deſcend of Abrah. &amp; the Faithful man are children of the promiſe &amp; covenant, &amp; ſo to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: I deſire you with al your knowledg reconcile theſe contradictions: &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay the Children of the Flesh are ſo oppoſed, that they can never bee the Children of the promiſe, &amp; that therfor the Children of the Faithful cannot bee ſo called carnal: I answer that al the children of the Iewes Church were borne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Flesh, Gal. 4.23-25. &amp; ſo were carnal, &amp; ſo are the Children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful: &amp; yet as many of the Iewes were afterward regenerate, &amp; children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe though al at the firſt children of the Flesh, ſo many of the infants of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may prove Children of the promiſe by Faith; though at the firſt al are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Flesh that is carnal: but I confeſſe indeed that Eſaw can never be Iacob: &amp; one ſo carnal can never be Spiritual: &amp; whereas you ſay, that carnal corruption doth not hinder infants from baptiſme, no more then men of yeeres that make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith, I answer yes: For men of yeeres confeſſing their ſinnes &amp; their Faith, declare the mortification of ſinne &amp; regeneration by the Spirit, infants being borne in ſinne, cannot nor doe not declare their regeneration at al to vs: &amp; ſo with them wee have nothing to doe: &amp; whereas you ſay natural corruption is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to infants no more then to men beleeving, let it bee ſo, &amp; yet you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that without the opinion of vniverſal redemption, &amp; then I ſay, that if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the Faithful being delivered from their natural corruption may therfore bee baptized, then al infants shal be baptized who are pertakers of the ſame benefit, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infants of Turkes: if you ſay no: Seing the infants of the Faithful are only redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; vnder the covenant, then you condemne al the infants that dye who are not borne of Faithful parents: &amp; yet you cannot prove that the infants of the Faithfull are vnder the actual poſſeſſion of the covenant, which is only by Faith, &amp; ſo the ſcruple ſtil remaineth vnloſed.</p>

I answer: that the external ſeale of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal covenant was particularly injoyned by God to every male, &amp; the knowledg of the reprobation of Eſaw &amp; Iſmael did not hinder that carnal ſeale: nor diſanul the precedent expreſſe commaundement of circumciſing every male of 8, dayes old: but now ſeing wee have no expreſſe commaundement for baptiſing infants, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commaundement &amp; many examples to the contrary, that only perſons made Diſciples by teaching, confeſſing their Faith &amp; their ſinnes, are to be baptized: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that infants borne of Faithful parents are the children of the Flesh, Rom. 9.7.

               <p>The firſt thing that in your Answer you intend to prove, is, that the baptiſme ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the Apoſtate Churches of Antichriſt is not to be reiterated.</p>

               <p>I Answer that the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt is deeper then the Apoſtacy of Iſraell, for firſt Antichriſtians are not called Iſraelites, but Babylonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Egyptians, Sodomites Gentils in the Revelation, wherby the holy Spirit of wiſdom giveth vs to conceave that he doth account the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt equal to Paganiſme it ſelf: yea to the very worſt kind of Paganiſme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I declare plainly the differences betwixt the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt &amp; Iſrael, in this, that Iſraels Apoſtacy did not deſtroy the true conſtitution of the chur: But Antichriſts Apoſtacy did raſe the true Apoſtolique conſtitution: For the true conſtitution of the Church of the old Teſtament was of carnal Iſraelites or Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites circumciſed: Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Faith then ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe: &amp; ſeing the true forme of the Church is a covenant betwixt God &amp; the Faithful made in baptiſme in which Chriſt is viſibly put on: &amp; that infants cannot receave the covenant which is only done by actual viſible Faith, nor cannot ſeale back vnto the Lord that hee is true, Ioh. 3.33 as God ſealeth vnto them his truth by his Spirit, Eph. 1.13. For the covenant is this, I wilbe their God. 2. Cor. 6.16. &amp; they shalbe al taught of God, Ioh. 6.45. &amp; shal al know God from the leaſt vnto the greateſt: Heb. 8.11. &amp; the covenant is this: I wilbe their Father, 2. Cor. 6:18. &amp; wee shalbe his ſonnes calling him Father by the Spirit, wherby we are ſealed, Gal. 4.6. Hence it followeth that the Church of Antichriſt being conſtituted of a falſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, viz: infants vncapable of baptiſme, &amp; of a falſe ſonne, viz: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants vnable to enter into the New Teſtament by ſealing back the covenant vnto the Lord, &amp; conſenting vnto the contract, therefore they can have no title to Chriſt or any of his ordinances, but are as pagans or Gentils in the Lords account. Circumciſion therfor in the Iſraelites Apoſtacy was true circumciſion, bicauſe it was performed vppon carnal Iſraelites or Proſelytes the eigth day: but baptiſme in Popery is falſe baptiſme, &amp; ſo in the Lords account no better then Pagan washing, being adminiſtred vppon infants a ſubject that God never appointed to baptiſme: a ſubject that is as vncapable of baptiſme as an infidel, a mad man, a naturall fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly I declare that Iſrael was the true Church of God, or a member or part of the true Church of God though infinitely corrupt aswel as Iudah in the dayes of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:26301:30"/> her Apoſtacy, ſee Ezechiel 3. toto. &amp; Ezech. 16. toto: &amp; Ezech. 20.28-31. &amp; therfor if Iudah retayned true circumciſion in her Apoſtacy when the L. calleth her a harlot Ezech. 16.35. &amp; the Apoſtacy of Iudah is worſe in the L. account then that of Iſrael Ezech. 16.47-53. Surely the circumciſion of Iſrael was alſo true, &amp; Iſrael a true part of the Church as wel as Indah: &amp; for the bil of divorce which ſome plead was given to Iſrael by Hoſea: Hoſ. 2.2. I ſay that was after the paſſeover of Hezechiah which was in the firſt yeer of his raigne, 2. Chron. 29.3.17. &amp; 30.2. &amp; the bil of divorce was given the ſixth yeer of his raigne, 2. King. 17.23. compared with 2. King. 18.10. yet nevertheleſſe Hoſea calleth Iſrael the Lords people after he had propheſied of the bil of divorce to be given, Hoſ. 4.6.8.12. &amp; when the bil of divorce was given, divers of Iſrael I doubt not, kept themſelves pure from Samaritaniſme, &amp; retained circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; came vp yeerly to Ieruſalem even til the dayes of Ioſiah, 2. Chron. 35.18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 2. Chron. 34.6.7.3-33. So that hereby it is moſt manifeſt that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſinne made the Church of the old Teſtament a falſe Church, ſo long as they retayned circumciſion in the Land of Canaan, yea if they retayned circumciſion though in Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherevppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am perſwaded that if the Papucy, or England, or the Greek Churches did only baptiſe men confeſſing their Faith &amp; their ſinnes into Chr, the Sonne of God, or into the Trinity, though they retayned their falſe miniſtery, worship &amp; Government, &amp; other ther abhominations yet the baptiſme was true &amp; not to be repeated: as their circumciſion was good notwithſtanding al their abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations &amp; horrible Idolatryes, &amp; fearful Apoſtacy in Iſrael.</p>

               <p>Babylon in Chaldea (which was a type of Spiritual Babylon, Apoc. 18.2.) though they did abuſe &amp; profan the veſſels of the L.

Even ſo although Spiritual Babylon have profaned the Holy things of God, as baptiſme &amp; the reſt, yet remaine they ſtil Gods ordinances to al them that come out of her, Apoc. 18.4. &amp; returne to the celeſtial Ieruſalem. &amp; as theſe veſſels of the howſe of the L. need not to be new caſt, bicauſe of Babels polluting them: no more is baptiſme to be reiterated to the people of God, bicauſe it paſſed thorow the polluted hands of the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>If it bee objected, that they that adminiſtred baptiſme in Babylon, were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; had no calling therto.</p>
               <p>I answere: That they which circumciſed in the Apoſtacy of Iſrael were Idolaters, &amp; ſo ſtanding in that eſtate could not be fit Miniſters of Gods holy ordinances. &amp; that the wanting of a lawful calling to adminiſter the Sacrament makes not a nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therof, the circumciſing of Moſes Sonne by his mother Zippora, Exod. 4.25. doth plainly teach. For as the Lord makes effectual his word to his people, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto them, by the hands of a falſe miniſtery, ſo doth he baptiſme to al that bee his, though adminiſtred by them that have not a Lawful calling thervnto. The ſin of the miniſter makes not a nullity either of the word or Sacraments, els thould the

               <p>If againe it be objected, that baptiſme was not adminiſtred in the Apoſtate Chur. of Antichriſt to a fit ſubject I answer that the children in the Apoſtacy were as fit ſubjects to receave baptiſme, as the infants of Iſraell in the dayes of Ieroboam &amp; Ahab, were to receave circumciſion: Seing the covenant of Abraham (after the comming of Chriſt) belonged as properly to the Gentils, Gal. 3.14. as before it did to the Iſraelites,</p>

               <p>Your ſecond argument followeth which is this in effect.</p>
               <p>As the Babilonians abuſe of the veſſels of the L. howſe did not make a nullity of them, but they were vſed after the captivity, Ezra. 1.11. ſo the Antichriſtian abuſe of baptiſme cannot diſanul it, but it may bee retayned when men come to the Fayth: &amp; it needeth not to be reiterated, no more then the veſſels of the howſe of the Lord be new caſt,</p>
               <p>I answer many things: Firſt, this arg. is an excellent arg. for the retayning of idoll Temples, the worship, government, miniſtery of the eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: if it be ſaid they were never apointed by God, ſo ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that baptiſme of theirs was never apointed by God: but is the deviſe of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answer, that the veſſels of the Lords howſe were his owne ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, &amp; therfor need not to be new caſt: but the baptiſme of Antichr. is not the L. owne ordinance who never ordeyned it: for you muſt diſtinguish them thus: The veſſels of the L. howſe were ſubſtances framed by art into particular shapes at the L. apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement but the baptiſme of the L. is a compound or concrete ordinance or action li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in certaine eſſential particulars: not being a ſubſtance but an accident in defini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion now if Antic had retained the eſſential parts of baptiſme, I confeſſe it needed not to be repeated, no more then the veſſels of the L, houſe need to be new caſt after the abuſe of the Babilonians: but ſeing baptiſme in popery &amp; Antichriſtianiſme, is not the L. ordinance in the definition of it, but Antich. invention: Therefor though the veſſels of the L. howſe may be retayned, yet baptiſme may not: That baptiſme is Antichr. invention in the definition of it, I manifeſt thus: The matter of baptiſme, &amp; the forme of baptiſme is invented by Antich. go: it is an invention of antichriſt in the definition: The matter of antichriſtian baptiſme is a carnal infant: The forme is, washing one into the covenant that cannot conſent to the covenant: or baptiſing without a contract &amp; ſealing the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts on both parts for the L. doth not ſeale to the infant, and the infant cannot ſeale to the Lord: As I have manifeſted already in the answer to the former argum. of yours: Therefore the baptiſme of antichr. is in the definition of it the meer deviſe of antichr. For the Scripture deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth true baptiſme which is the Lords owne ordinance thus: The matter muſt bee one that confeſſeth his Fayth &amp; his ſinnes, one that is regenerate &amp; borne againe: The forme muſt bee a voluntary delivering vp of the party baptized into the Name of the Father, Sonne, &amp; Holy Spirit, by washing with water, Mat. 28.19.

               <p>Thirdly, I answer, that if the Antichriſtians had baptized perſons confeſſing their ſinnes &amp; their Faith into the name of the Sonne of God, &amp; the Trinity, it had then been true baptiſme though in the hands of the Antichriſtians, as the veſſels of the L. howſe, in the hands or the Caldees, &amp; therfor needed no repetition, as theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels needed no new caſting: Therfor we keep the Scriptures ſtill though they abuſe them, &amp; the Church, miniſtery, worship, &amp; government taught in the Scriptures though they have poluted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but their deviſed word, that is their Apocrypha wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings &amp; falſe doctrine, &amp; their deviſed church conſiſting of carnal infants &amp; perſons vnbaptized, &amp; their deviſed worship of the maſſe, &amp; their deviſed miniſtery of the ſacrificing Preiſthood, &amp; their deviſed government of the Prelacy we abhorre, &amp; vt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terly reject, as the very deviſed Idols of antic. &amp; we wil no more retaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Shrines of Diana, then the Iews would the wedg of Acha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo ſay we of his baptiſme.</p>
               <p>And heer you answer two objections.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that though the Antichriſtians that adminiſter baptiſme bee Idolaters, yet it may bee true baptiſme aswel as circumciſion true by the Iſraelites that were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters: &amp; that the efficacy of the word &amp; Sacraments dependeth not vpon the worth of the miniſter: as circumciſion by Zipporah declareth, Exod. 4-5. I answer: Firſt, what ſay you to Ciprian the auncient Fathers, &amp; all the counſel of leaned Bbs. who concluded that the baptiſme of Heretiques was a nullity &amp; decreed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſing.</p>
               <p>Secondly I ſay that the Iſraelites circumciſion was in a true church &amp; antich. bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is in a falſe Church &amp; that is a diſſimilitude.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I know nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the contrary, but Zipporah might circumciſe her Sonne, her husband commaunding her (for where is it ſaid in al the Old Teſtament that a woman shal not circumciſe) for Moſes indeed did circumciſe though Zippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah was the hand of Moſes in the action, as it is the Kings action if the L. Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of the judg of an aſſiſe do it. Fourthly I yee'd that the Miniſter shal not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice baptiſme, if the baptiſme bee the Lords owne ordinance, that is, if a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bee inveſted with baptiſme true in the definition: &amp; yet you know that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſwe of weomen is ſtrongly queſtioned, &amp; I beleeve it would trouble you to ſatiſfie a doubt made of a midwifes baptiſme in England, that it ought not to bee repeated, or of a Child baptiſing others as Athanaſius did in ſport, (which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26301:32"/> Alexander Bb. of Alexandria with his Clerkes did approve) whither it ought to bee repeated yea or nay: but I leave this point as being but off ſmall importance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond objection you answer is, that although baptiſme be adminiſtred in a falſe Church of Antichriſt vppon an vnfit ſubject, yet it shal not be repeated, no more then circumciſion in the dayes of Ieroboam &amp; Ahab, it being adminiſtred vppon an vnfit ſubject: I ſay, as I have ſaid divers tymes, that the Iſraelites infants in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection were the ſubject that God commaunded to be circumciſed, viz: the ſeed of Abrah. males of 8. dayes age. So are not the infants in Antichriſtianiſme, both for that they are 1. infants, 2. members of a falſe Church, 3. The ſeed of vnbelevers which by your owne confeſſion have no title to baptiſme: &amp; whereas you ſay that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Abrah. in reſpect of Chr. did as truly belong to the Gentils after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chr. as it did to the Iſraelites though both in defection: I deny it: For the carnal covenant belonged to the Iſraelites the carnal ſeed of Abrah. even in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Apoſtacy, &amp; the Spiritual covenant made with Abrah. in reſpect of Chr. did never aperteyne to the 1. Apoſtate parents, 2. much leſſe to the infants of them in their Apoſtacy, 3. no nor to the infants of the faithful as I have already proved, &amp; Gal. 2.14. is not to be vnderſtood of the bleſſing of Abrah. to come vpon any of the Gentils in their Apoſtacy, but only being in Chriſt, as the words are, alſo vſ. 7. &amp; 9. but the externall Covenant was made with Abraham &amp; the carnall Iſraelites onely vppon the condition of circumciſion carnally vppon the males of eigt dayes old, Gen. 17.10.</p>

               <p>Your third Argument followeth which is this in effect.</p>
               <p>The word in the falſe Miniſtery of Antichriſt is avayleable to convert: Ergo: The baptiſme is alſo avayleable to ſeale vp the covenant to the converted, &amp; ſo need not be repeated.</p>
               <p>I answer: Firſt the word converteth none viſibly to me particularly known: So ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptiſme ſeale vp none viſibly to me: what they do both in ſecreat the L. knoweth &amp; what the word doth generally I know by that place Rev. 18.4. Alſo what the bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme doth ſpecially I know, for God ſaith plainly whoſoever receaveth the mark of the beaſt in his forehead shal perish, Rev. 14.9-11. this mark is vndoubtedly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme wherby they are initiated into Antichriſt, &amp; receave his mark, as Chriſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in baptiſme receave his ſeale vppon them: (remember I cal baptiſme a ſeale in the concrete, or according to your opinion. For otherwiſe I deny it to be a ſeale) ſo that Antichriſtian Baptiſme is rather a ſeale of perdition to the Antichriſtians, then of the covenant or Salvation by Chriſt: &amp; therfor it is to be renounced.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Antichriſts baptiſme falſe (as I have ſaid) in the difinitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is none of Gods ordinance no not in the hands of the moſt faithful miniſter of rhe world: but Gods word is the Lords ordinance, though in the mouth of the moſt vile Iudas or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian in the world, yea though it be in the mixture of a 1000 hereſies: So that in this reſpect alſo it followeth not that though Gods word may convert in popery, therfor Antichriſts baptiſme may ſeale: but ſtil you build vppon a falſe fondacion as you ſee, aſſuming that which is the queſtion, viz: That baptiſme in popery is the Lords.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I answer againe, that if Antichriſt had reteyned the L. true baptiſme, as I have deſcribed true I ſay in the definition, viz: That he had baptized perſons confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſinnes &amp; faith into the Trinity, or into Ieſus Chriſt, it should not have been repeated: but ſeing he intendeth in baptiſme, to ſet an indelible character vpon them which is the mark of the beaſt, to conferre grace ex opere operato to the infants which he washeth, another promiſing &amp; answering for them Credo &amp; Abrenuntio which the party baptized should himſelf performe, hence I conclude that he hath ſet vp his owne idol of abhomination, &amp; caſt the L. holy ordinance away, having eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialy deſtroyed the primitive Apoſtolique baptiſme go his baptiſme is a nullity or rather a ſeale of perdition to them that retaine it.</p>
               <p>The amplification which you bring to this Argument I omit as a thing not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but yeelded vnto that God can work by a falſe Miniſtery, evil inſtruments, &amp; bad meanes, but hence it wil not follow that we may retaine the mark of the beaſt, no more then we may retaine the miniſtery of Antichriſt, the Church of Antichriſt, the Government of Antichriſt.</p>

               <p>Therfor not to be rejected for the Authors ſake.</p>
               <p>The minor you prove thus, ſaying the baptiſme though falſe in reſpect of humane deviſes vſed in the miniſtration therof, yet is true in reſpect of the matter, forme &amp; Author therof: &amp; in your answer to my ſecond Arg. you ſay: the author of baptiſme in the Kingdom of Antichr. is Chr. the matter water: the forme washing with water into the Trinity.</p>
               <p>I answer directely, that if it could bee proved that baptiſme in the Kingdome of Antichriſt is appointed by Chriſt, &amp; that water is the true matter of baptiſme, &amp; the true forme is washing into the Trinity, I would yeeld vnto you: but this you have not proved, &amp; I have already proved the contrary: but yet to deale ſomthing more fully in this point which is the mayne pillar &amp; cheef corner Stone of the fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion, I ſay: 1. VVater is not the matter of baptiſme, but onely the inſtrument of baptiſme: For as fire is the inſtrument of burning, ſo is VVater of washing: the matter of burning is the fewel that is burnt, So the matter of washing is the party washed: For as wee ſay accident is eſſe eſt ineſſe: &amp; the ſubject is al the matter of an accident: &amp; as the matter of the Church are the Diſciples of Sayntes: The matter of the Miniſtery are the Prophets, ſo the matter of baptiſme is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, vppon whome baptiſme is conferred, &amp; on whome it is. It is falſe therfor which you affirme that water is the matter of baptiſme. 2. I ſay that washing into the Name of the Father, Sonne, &amp; Holy Ghoſt, is not the forme of Baptiſme: For to wash a Turk, Iew, Foole, mad Man, or infant into the Trinity is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ne baptiſme: but it were ſo, if ſimply to baptize into the Trinity were the forme of baptiſme: Therefore to baptiſe the true matter into the true Fayth, or into Chriſt, or the New Teſtament, or the Trinity, or into the true body,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:26301:33"/> is the true forme of baptiſme: So that the true matter of baptiſme is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: one regenerate: a confeſſor. As the true matter of circumciſion was a male of eigt dayes old eyther lineally deſcending of Abraham, or a Proſelite: So the true matter of baptiſme is a perſon that is of the Fayth of Abraham, one that hath the male Chriſt formed in him: The true forme of baptiſme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in three things, (1.) washing with water, (2.) a new Creature, (3.) into the Name of Chr. or into the Trinity, for I think wee are not tyed to forme of words. &amp; ſo if antichr. hath washed any, I ſay, I wil never conſent that they shalbe rebaptized, but hold that Anabaptiſtery true hereſy.</p>
               <p>But if an infant that is not the matter of baptiſme, or a wicked man, mad man, foole, Turk, or Iew, or any Pagan bee washed with water into the Trinity, I ſay ther is neyther true matter nor forme of baptiſme, &amp; Chriſt is not the author thereof: &amp; therfor the baptiſme of antichriſt is not Chriſts, but his owne, &amp; ſo all infants baptized by antichriſt are eyther vnbaptized or have the marke of the beaſt, &amp; ſo are to renounce it, &amp; to receave Chriſts marke of baptiſme, or els woe bee to them: &amp; when they shall manifeſt a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; Chriſt the male is formed in them, &amp; they confeſſe with their mouth &amp; then be baptized into the Trinity, this is not anabaptiſtery, but the true primitive Apoſtolique Baptiſme, &amp; ſo Chriſt, Iohn, Chriſts Apoſtles were anabaptiſts with you Sir: For they baptized men that had been washed before a thouſand tymes with the Iewes baptiſmes, Heb. 9.10. which baptiſmes were alſo into the Meſſias (no doubt) in thoſe that ſaw the end off thoſe Figures: But if it bee blaſphemy to ſay that Chriſt, Iohn, &amp; the Apoſtles were Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, though they were of tymes ſome of them baptized into the Meſſiah in Type, bicauſe they were onely once baptized truly &amp; indeed: So shal it bee blaſphemy in all them that call the true Chriſtians anabaptiſts, that baptize new Creatures once onely into Chriſt, though baptized before by antichriſt in their infancy when they knew not the right hand from the left, or what a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the New Teſtament, or Chriſt, or Baptiſme, or any thing els was: hence therefore I conclude vndenyably that ſeing Popish baptiſme hath a falſe matter, &amp; a falſe forme, therefore it is antichriſts Idoll aſmuch as a falſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, &amp; a falſe Church is: &amp; ſo the Lord is not the author of it: &amp; therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon though the Scriptures &amp; Gods word bee retayned by Gods providence &amp; in the word all the Holy things of God, through Popery: yet in the Popish Churches ther is no true Church, Miniſtery, VVorship, or Government, nor true Baptiſme, but all falſe and Antichriſtian: and ſo to bee rejected, and the truth to bee aſſumed out of the Scriptures: and ſo this argument off yours is answered.</p>

Iohn. 4.1. Then ſeing you confeſſe that a true Church may bee erected, you cannot deny (though you doe deny it in oppoſing the truth) that baptiſme may alſo bee recovered: &amp; ſeing when all Chriſts viſible ordinances are loſt, eyther men muſt recover them againe, or muſt let them alone: if they let them alone til extraordinary men come with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles &amp; tongs, as the Apoſtles did, then men are ſame liſts (for that is their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) or if they muſt recover them, men muſt beginne ſo to doe, &amp; then two men joyning together may make a Church (as you ſay): Why may they not baptize ſeing they cannot conjoyne into Chriſt but by baptiſme, Mat. 28.19. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Mat. 18.10.

The eſtate &amp; condition of people now is not alike to the eſtate of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles or Iewes in the Apoſtles tymes, they differ in divers reſpects: Firſt, all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then both of Iewes &amp; Gentiles never had bene themſelves, nor were ever of the poſterity of thoſe that had bene members of the Church of Chriſt vnder the goſpel, ſeing then was the firſt planting of Evangelical Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we are now the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſuch parents as were members of the Chu. planted by the Apo. els could we not have Apoſtated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that people, which the Apo. gathered in to Churches were never bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, &amp; baptiſme comming in the ſteed of circumciſion, &amp; being a ſeale of our entring into Gods covenant, it was fit, that they which beleved &amp; became the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should ſo enter into the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they &amp; their ſeed, as he &amp; his ſeed entred, that is, as he &amp; his were receaved in by circumciſion: So they &amp; thers should be receved in by baptiſme, Act. 2.38.41, &amp; 8.38. but we are a people that are already baptized, &amp; the ſeed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wer baptized, &amp; had receved the goſpel, &amp; (although through Antichr. deceaveablenes, both we &amp; they were tainted with many corruptions) yet had they or might have in that Apoſtacy, (&amp; ſo we alſo) ſo much faith, as thereby both we &amp; they might become the people of God, Apoc. 18.4.</p>

               <p>And concerning the conſtitution of the Churches, here it is to be noted, that the conſtitution of Churches ſet downe by the Apoſtles was by the immediate directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; ſo ſerveth for a continual rule of eſtablishing Churches to the end of the world, which forme or frame layed downe by them, no man hath power to alter or change, 1.

But the conſtituting of Chur. now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the defection of Antich. may more properly be called a repayring, then a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of Churches, which through Apoſtacy have bene ruinated, or a gathering to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether of the diſperſed, hepe of Iſraell into ſuch formes or shapes of viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (the pate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And herein I take it, lyeth the deceyte of this arg. that it putteth no difference be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween the people of God comming out of Babylon, &amp; them that came to the faith from amongſt the Gentils, equaliſing Antichriſtianiſme with Gentiliſme, the one being an Apoſtate Church, the other no Church: The one partaker of the word &amp; Sacram: (though with much coruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the other partaker of neither at all, the one profeſſing Chriſt &amp; Teaching many truths of God, &amp; ſo many as the elect therby might come to faith, Apoc. 18.4.

               <p>And in that the Apoſtles receaved in members by baptiſme, they could doe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſeing the whole world was vnbaptized, but if they had met with any that before had bene baptized into the name of Chr. as they that receaved the baptiſme of Iohn, &amp; as we are, I make no queſtion, they did not, nor would not have rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them, &amp; the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As in the former point for baptiſing of infants you were compelled to runne to the old Teſtament, &amp; from thence to fetch the cheef corner ſtone of your building viz. from circumciſion: So in this ſecond point you vtterly forſake the new Teſtam. of Chr. &amp; the true conſtitution Apoſtolique of the Church of the new Teſtament, &amp; ſet vs againe to Schoole to Moſes, as if Chr. had not bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faithful enough to teach vs his new Teſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we muſt go learne the new Teſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the old Teſtament: Chr. of Moſes: The Goſpel of the Law.</p>

Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ. 17.10-14. The forme of the Church of the New Teſtament is the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the hart, a new Creature, the Holy Spirit of promiſe whereby wee are ſealed, which is manifeſted by confeſſion &amp; baptiſme in water: Act. 10.47.

Their carnall Church in the matter &amp; forme came by carnall Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, &amp; ſo they all of them were gendred vnto bondage vnder the rudimentes off the VVorld vnder the carnal Teſtament or covenant: Gallat. 4.24.25. our Spirituall Church in the matter &amp; forme thereof is by Spirituall Genealogie, that is the Genealogie of the Fayth of Abraham the Father of vs all vnder the Spirituall New Teſtament, Gallat. 3.7.9.14.

Their miniſtery was a carnal miniſtery by carnal genealogie of the line of Aaron Sacrificing Preiſts: our miniſtery is by Spiritual genealogie of the election of the true Church that is Spiritual.</p>
               <p>Thus if you would compare the Type &amp; the Truth together, you should eaſily diſcerne the ſandy Fondation of your falſe Church ruinated &amp; your falſe baptiſme quite abandoned: who continue a Church by ſucceſſion of a carnall line, &amp; a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme by ſucceſſion vppon the carnall Line through Popery: VVhereas the true Church is onely by the Spirituall Line of Fayth, &amp; true baptiſme by the Spirituall ſucceſſion vppon that Spirituall Line of Faythfull men confeſſing their Fayth &amp; their ſinnes, which was typed by that carnal Line of the Old Teſtament: you therefore that introduce a carnal Line into the Church to bee baptized, viz: all your Children according to the Flesh &amp; that by ſucceſſion fetch baptiſme vppon that carnal Line through the Church of Rome into your Church (following the preſident of the Old Teſtament in that carnal circumciſion by ſucceſſion of Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie) doe therein vnawares make Rome a true Church, your ſelves Schiſmatiques, &amp; ſet vp Iudaiſme in the New Teſtament, &amp; ſo are fallen from Chriſt, &amp; are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new ſecond image of the Beaſt never heard of before in the VVorld: For
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:26301:37"/> ſuch are you of the Seperation.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed as a ground which I earneſtly in treat you (even in my beſt love vnto you) &amp; al the Seperation, eſpecialy the leaders of them, well to weigh &amp; ponder, &amp; not to be ashamed to learne of their inferiors &amp; juniors: I come to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swer the exceptions which you take at my firſt Argument.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of your exception is this: That ſeing wee are the poſterity of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſons, &amp; the Iewes &amp; Gentiles in the Apoſtles tymes were not ſo: Therefore wee need not aſſume baptiſme in our entrance into the Church, which wee had in our Apoſtacy, but wee may enter into the Church without rebaptizing as the Apoſtate Iſraelites did without recircumciſing: &amp; ſo we muſt not in the new Teſt. be framed according to the paterne taught in the new Teſt. in entering in by baptiſme, but according to the paterne of the old Teſtam. &amp; the Apoſtate Iſraelites therein, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I answer divers things: Firſt, I ſay that the New Teſtament is as ſufficient for the direction of al the affaires &amp; occaſions that befall in the tyme of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as the Old Teſtament was for the occurrences that befell vnder the Old Teſtament: Seing Chriſt is as Faythful as Moſes: &amp; the New Teſtament as perfect as the Old. Gal. 3.15. &amp; therefore if the Lord had intended to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Apoſtolique conſtitution of Churches, &amp; our conſtituting of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſons to be admitted into the Church, &amp; in reſpect of baptiting &amp; not baptiſing or rebaptiſing of them he could &amp; would have done it: but ſeing it is not done in the New Teſtament, but left in ſilence: &amp; ſeing the New Teſtament of Chr. is perfect &amp; ſealed with his blood, you that put this difference add to the new Teſtament, &amp; bring in a new Chriſt, a new covenant, a new Goſpel, a new Church, &amp; new baptiſme: &amp; wo be to them that ad to the word, Rev. 22.18. &amp; as they were accurſed that added to the old Teſt. Deut. 4.2. &amp; 12.32. So much more shal they be ſubject to the cauſe that add to the new Teſt. of Chr. Heb. 12.25. in this reſpect ther for your answer is inſufficient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I affirme that (as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith) the Antichriſtians are in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equall to Pagans, &amp; therefore as I have ſaid they are not called Iſraelites or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritanes, but Babylonians, Egyptians, Sodomites, Gentills: but the Holy Ghoſt knoweth what &amp; how to ſpeak: And therefore as the Babylonians, Egyptians, Sodomites, Gentils washings were nothing, no more is the baptiſme of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians any thing: For the Holy Ghoſt foreſeeing that the Antichriſtians would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish the true baptiſme of Chriſt by baptiſing infants, &amp; ſo by admitting into the Church the carnal ſeed of the Flesh, would diſanul that Holy ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, &amp; ſo abolish the true conſtitution of the Church, in heavenly wiſdom for our inſtruction calleth perſons Apoſtating from the true conſtitution of the Church Babylonians, Egyptians, Sodomites, Gentils, therby teaching vs that he eſteemeth no otherwiſe of their Church or baptiſme, then of the Synagogues of Babylon; then of the washings of Egypt, then of the worship of Sodom &amp; the Pagans: &amp; theſe compariſons will fit you well againſt the aſſemblies &amp; Temples of Antichriſt, and I know no reaſon that they thould not fitt vs aswell againſt your Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, Egyptians, Sodomitish, and Paganish washings of infants which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:26301:38"/> which though it bee done into the name of Chr. yet is no more avayleable in the Holy Ghoſts teſtimony then washing of Pagans, Babylonians, Egyptians, Sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Children.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wheras you ſay that repayring the Church now after the Apoſtacy of Antichr. is a fitter ſpeech then conſtituting: herein do you both taxe your ſelves off the vſe of that word conſtitution: &amp; plainly ſignifie that you incline to maintain the Churches of England &amp; Rome to be true Churches, wherin whither you doe not forſake your firſt faith, &amp; turne with the dog to the vomit look you vnto it, &amp; let al indifferent men judg: but your writings are againſt you ſufficient witneſſes in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſay that the Iewes that were converted to the Faith &amp; new Teſtament of Chr. by Chr. Iohn, &amp; the Apoſtles in your account were in a far better eſtate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichr. For they (as you ſay) were of the ſame body with the Church of the New Teſtament, &amp; their circumciſion was a ſeale of the new Teſtament (as you ſay) &amp; they were in Chr. Ieſus (as you ſay) &amp; were washed I doubt not many of them into the Meſſias whoſe blood they typically ſaw in their manifold baptiſmes &amp; purifications with water: &amp; al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had been partakers of the word &amp; Sacraments in the Chur. of the Iewes, &amp; why might not they by Chriſt, Iohn, or the Apo. be admitted into the Church without baptiſme: if therfor Chr. Iohn. &amp; the Apo. would needes bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, &amp; ſo by baptiſme conſtitute them into the new Teſtament that had all theſe perogatives in your judgment, much more wil they have vs to conſtitute An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichr. converted into the true Church by baptiſme: neither can you ſay without great indignity to the L. ordinances in the old Teſt. that they were inferior to the baptiſme of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe you wil needes have this to be a great priviledg to the antichr. to be the carnal ſeed of them that hath ſomtyme been members of the Church of Chr. in the new Teſtament, &amp; therfor you ſay that in ther parents or aunceſtors they had title to baptiſme: I deny that ever the English nation of any one of our predeceſſors were of the Faith of Chr. shew it if you can: but we came of a Pagan race til Rome the mother came &amp; put vppon vs her falſe baptiſme: &amp; therfor although the Roma. might plead this, yet England cannot plead it: &amp; ſo your diſſimilitude cannot hold in that thing: &amp; our caſe is ſimply Paganish.</p>
               <p>Further, you ſay that the repentance of Apoſtate Churches is ſufficient for their admittance into the true Church without rebaptization, as repentance was for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael without recircumciſion: I deny it, for the Churches of Antichr. are falſe, &amp; the Church of the Iſraelites was not falſe: The Churches of Antichr. were falſe bicauſe they conſiſted of the carnal ſeed baptized which was not that one ſeed vnto which the promiſe was made, that is the Faithful: The Church of the Iſraelites was true bicauſe it did conſiſt of the carnal ſeed carnally circumciſed, which was the true conſtitution of the Church of the old Teſtament: For otherwiſe if Iſrael had been falſe bicauſe of their Apoſtacy &amp; Idolatry then Iudah was as falſe who had in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes juſtified Samaria &amp; Sodom, Ezech. 16.51. but indeed they were neither of them falſe ſo long as they circumciſed the males of 8. dayes old, but the Churches of Antichr. growing falſe by baptiſing the carnal ſeed (which was not the true ſeed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26301:38"/> of Abrahams faith) therefore are to bee baptized when they come to the truth, &amp; cannot have Iſraels Apoſtacy for the preſident: wherefore an Edomite or Iſraelite comming to bee a proſelite of the Iewes Church that had omitted circumciſion is a true Preſident of the Antichriſtian Apoſtacy: For as they omitting the circumciſion of the males though of the Poſterity of Abraham, yet being Proſelites were entered into the Iewes Church by circumciſion: So is it in the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt, with the Proſelytes of Antichriſtianiſme: for ſo I take it the Proſelytes were types of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians, converted to the Faith, &amp; admitted into the true Church: &amp; the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites were not ſo.</p>
               <p>Moreover whereas you ſay that if the Apoſtles had met with ſuch as we are they would have receaved vs into the Church vppon repentance without baptiſme: I answer, if ſuch an example had been left vs wee would then have reſted ſatiſfied, but ſeing the Apo. have left no ſuch example nor precept therfor you are yet in your Apoſtacy, &amp; having not repented of nor forſaken your Egyptian baptiſme are ſtil vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperated, do ſtil retaine the mark of the beaſt, &amp; are ſubject to the woe that the aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gel threatneth to perſons ſo marked.</p>

               <p>Now let vs come to the ſecond reaſon which is this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Bicauſe true baptiſme is but one, but the baptiſme of Antichriſt is not true baptiſme, &amp; ſo not that one baptiſme of Chr. but al the members of Chr. muſt have true Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Answere. </p>
               <p n="2">2. Ther is but one Faith &amp; one baptiſme, Eph. 4 4. &amp; therefore is it ſufficient to bee once baptized, as it was to bee once circumciſed: Secondly, That the baptiſme of Antichriſt is not true baptiſme I graunt, &amp; doe alſo affirme that al members of Chriſt muſt have true baptiſme, &amp; what then muſt it follow that now ſuch as are baptized muſt bee rebaptized, els cannot bee members of a viſible Church: I deny it &amp; doe further answere, 1. That the baptiſme which wee receaved in the Apoſtate Church is no more Antichriſts then the word that wee receaved therein: For Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt did never ordaine a new kynd of baptiſme, but did onely pollute (with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions) the Holy ordinance of Chr: &amp; therefore if this baptiſme that wee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved be called the baptiſme of Antichr. that is to affirme an vntruth, ſeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution thereof was by Ieſus Chr. who commaunded his Apo. to baptize al nations with water in the name of the Father &amp; of the Sonne, &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt. &amp; the ſame baptiſme for ſubſtance is ſtil retayned in the Apoſtate churches &amp; none other. Secondly, this baptiſme may alſo in ſome reſpect bee called true baptiſme, as before I have noted in my fift reaſon againſt rebaptization: For 1. it hath Chr. for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, 2. it hath the true matter outward ſigne or element which is water, 3. the true forme of adminiſtring the ſame, which is, baptiſing into the name of the Father, of the Sonne, &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt, al which is practiſed in the Popish Church, neither
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26301:39"/> is any baptized into the name or faith of Antich. but vnto the faith &amp; poſſeſſion of Chriſt. &amp; therfor our baptiſme is the baptiſme of Chr. &amp; to vs that repent true baptiſme, &amp; ſo conſequently not to be reiterated.</p>

               <p>The ſumme of your answer is: That the baptiſme we receaved in the falſe Chur. is not Antichr. but Chriſts: I make answer, that ſeing infants are baptized which is the falſe matter of baptiſme, &amp; ſeing in them ther is not the queſtion of a good con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience vnto God, 1. Pet. 3.21. Nor the haſt ſprinckled from an evil conſcience, Heb. 10 22. which is the forme: Seing they cannot expreſſe credis? Credo: Abrenuntias? Abrenuncio: which is the forme of baptiſme even the mutual contract betwixt God &amp; the party baptized expreſſed viſibly in confeſſion: therfor the baptiſme is not Chr. but Antichriſts, not from heaven but of man: &amp; al that you object in this particular is already ſufficiently taken away in answer to your 4. reaſon: whither I tranſlated that which is heer answered by you vppon occaſion ther intertayned.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>The third reaſon.</p>
               <p>Bicauſe as the falſe Church is rejected &amp; the true erected, the falſe miniſtery for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, &amp; the true received: ſo falſe worship (&amp; by conſequence baptiſme) muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, &amp; the true baptiſme aſſumed.</p>
               <p>Anſwere.</p>
               <p>Firſt. I graunt, that we ought to Seperate from al falſe or apoſtate Chur. Apo. 18.4 &amp; to adjoyne our ſelves to a true Chu. reformed according to the paterne of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, 2. alſo every falſe miniſtery is to be forſaken, Mat. 7.15.2 Io. 10. gal. 1.8. &amp; the true miniſters of God to be received, Ier. 3.14.15. So did the faithful in Iſrael for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the falſe Preiſts ſet vp by Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; returned to the Preiſts of the L to Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 2. Chro. 30.11.3. it is our duty likewiſe to renounce al falſe wor. 2. Cor. 6.14-17 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. 30.22. &amp; to worship the L, as he taught vs in his word: &amp; thus far do I approve of this reaſon, but the conſequence I muſt deny, viz: that bicauſe falſe worship is to be renounced, therfor baptiſme alſo. For 1. we are to conſider in that baptiſme recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in apoſtate Churches two things, firſt, that which is of God therin. 2. that which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26301:39"/> is of man, that which is of God, is the ſubſtance of baptiſme, as before is obſerved, viz: the ſame matter &amp; forme that the L. inſtituted, &amp; likewyſe the ſame end which is the profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt, &amp; this is not falſe worship, &amp; ſo conſequently not to be renounced.</p>
               <p>Againe, that which in the adminiſtration of baptiſme is deviſed by man, are thoſe vnwarrantable ceremonies of croſſing, breathing, annoynting, &amp;c. theſe are to bee renounced as vaine worship, Mat. 15.4. Now the ordinances of God are to be purged from the pollutions of men, &amp; not with their pollutions to be renounced, for if polu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might warrant men to caſt away with it, that which is ordeyned of God, then might not the holy veſſels polluted in Babylon have bene brought againe to Ieruſa: nor yet the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple it ſelfe, that was ſo greatly profaned in the dayes of the Idolatrous Kings have any more bene vſed as a place of worsh. to the L. Secondly, I answer that we have receaved a true baptiſme in the apoſtate Chu. as the people of God did cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion amongſt the ten trybes: &amp; therfor we may no more renounce it, &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a new, then they that returned to Ieruſ. 2. Chro. 30.11. might renounce theire c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rcumciſion, &amp; be recircumciſed,</p>
               <p>It is objected of ſome, that this compariſon houlds not, for Iſrael was a true Chu. &amp; therfor their circumciſion was true: but Apoſtate Churches have nothing true, neither are the members therof capable either of the covenant or ſeale in that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; it is not true baptiſme to ſuch.</p>
               <p>This objection in part I have answered before, &amp; now answer further, 1. that the Iſraelites in their Apoſtacy were not a true Church, but falſe: ſeing they Seperated from Ieruſ. the true &amp; only Chu. in the world, &amp; erected a new Church &amp; comunio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, joyning together in a falſe wor. &amp; vnder a falſe miniſtery, 1. King. 12.30-33.20. &amp; 18.19—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. &amp; ſo became an harlot, Hoſ. 2.2. Secondly in the apoſtate Chur. ther be ſome things true in the ſubſtance as the word &amp; baptiſme, though co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupted in the adminiſtration therof by falſe miniſters, &amp; humane deviſes. Thirdly the members of an apoſtate Chu. are to be conſidered two wayes, 1. as they ſtand mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſuch a Chur. Secondly, as they are the ſeed &amp; poſterity of their forfathers which receaved the covenant for themſelves &amp; for their ſeed: &amp; though in regard of the former eſtate, they have nether right to baptiſme or the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (for the holy things of God belongs not properly to falſe Chu. nor to the members therof conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in that eſtate) yet even to ſuch members conſidered apart from ſuch ſtanding &amp; as they are the ſeed of their forfathers, ſo are they capable of the covenant &amp; Sacra. &amp; the ſame is avayleable to them vppon their repentance: For in apoſtate Churches God hath his people which are beloved for their Fathers ſakes, Rom. 11.28. &amp; this apeareth in that he ſaith, come out of her my people, Apo. 18.4. &amp; to ſuch it cannot be denyed, but that to them belongs the covenant, yea whyles they are in Spirituall Babylon, as it did to the Iewes that were in Babylon of Chaldea: bondage hinders not Cods grace.</p>
               <p>But ſome may reply, that they whoſe Fathers were Idolaters &amp; vnbeleevers cold have no right to the covenant to be baptized through the Faith of their Fathers. I answer, the right that children have to Gods covenant depends not only vpon their immediate parents, but title therto deſcends vnto them, from their aunceſtors
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:26301:40"/> Exo. 20. if wee reſpect herein Gods mercy, even as mens inheritance doe from their former Fathers: neither do the members of an Apoſtate Church caſt of al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, for ſuch beleve the Scriptures, &amp; in Ch. &amp;c. though with al they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe divers errors, &amp; worship the true God in a falſe manner.</p>
               <p>If queſtion be made how it can be proved that the members of an Apoſtate Chu. had forfathers that beleved. I answere, it cannot be denyed, ſeing that an Apoſtate Church ariſeth not out of a company of infidels (for then could it not be called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate ſeing that to apoſtate muſt be in regard of the truth) but is the ruines of a true Church, &amp; therfor it muſt needs follow that their forfathers were belevers, &amp; had receaved the covenant.</p>
               <p>And thus have <hi>I</hi> breifly answered theſe two Anabaptiſtical poſitions with theire reaſons, as the Lor. hath inabled me for the preſent, wishing this labour might have bene taken in hand by ſuch as could better performe it. &amp; further I do intreate, that the truth (which I contend for), may not, through my weake defence, beare any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, but that which is falt worthy, let it returne vpon my head. &amp; do alſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly pray that he that hath thus written, &amp; both he &amp; they that ſo practiſe, may ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider of that which is done, &amp; glorify God by their repentance.

               <p>Heer you endevour to prove that Iſrael was a falſe Church, bicauſe it Seperated from Iudah, &amp; bicauſe they joyned together in a new Church &amp; communion, vnder a falſe miniſtery &amp; worship, &amp; became a harlot wherto I answer that ſo was Iudah a falſe Ch: when they worshipped Idols vnder every gree<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tree, &amp; in the high places: &amp; if you ſo vnderſtand a falſe Church, viz: meetings, or companyes of men aſſembled together in a wrong place, &amp; to a wrong worship, vnder a wrong Preiſthood, I yeeld Iſrael ſo to be a falſe Church, but I deny that to be the true definition of a falſe Chu. for a falſe Church is contrary to a true Church: now a true Church is deſcerned in the true cauſes eſſential: &amp; ſo a falſe Church is known by the want of thoſe true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes eſſential: the true eſſential cauſes of the Chu. of the old Teſt was the poſterity of Abrah. or proſelytes circumciſed: the want of theſe things only made a falſe Chur: So long as the Iſraelites retained circumciſion, they were the true carnal conſtituted Church of the old Teſt: &amp; Iſrael &amp; Iudah are called harlots, not for that they were a falſe Church, but for the worshipping of God in Idols, as before the calves at Dan &amp; Bethel, or the Idols in Iudah, this is plaine enough in the Hiſtory. So that I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude againſt you that Iſrael was no falſe Church in the conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but had a true matter &amp; forme, viz: circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed Iſraelites though vnder a falſe miniſtery, worship, &amp; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I have already shewed in the former treatiſe.</p>

               <p>Secondly I ſay that no man is vnder the covenant or vnder baptiſme for the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſake: &amp; that is not the meaning of the Ap.

No: we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the baptiſme is eſſentially falſe &amp; none of Chr. &amp; therfor it is the character or mark of the beaſt, openly retained in the forhead of al the ſubjects of Antic. who profeſſing themſelves to be of that baptiſme do profeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to be of that body for of that body they are of whoſe baptiſme they are, &amp; of that baptiſme they are of whoſe body they are, 1.
